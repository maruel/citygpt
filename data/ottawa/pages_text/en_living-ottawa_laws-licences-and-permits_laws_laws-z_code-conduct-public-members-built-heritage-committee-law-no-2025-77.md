1. The abovementioned protocol does not apply to a pecuniary interest in any matter that a public member may have,

### Section 12 - Conduct Respecting Lobbying

1. Public members of the Built Heritage Committee, as members of a Committee of Council, may be approached by various individuals attempting to influence decisions before Committee and Council. While lobbying is an acceptable practice, disclosure of lobbying activities enhances the transparency and integrity of City business.
1. In accordance with the City’s Lobbyist Registry, public members of the Built Heritage Committee shall review the Lobbyist Registry on a monthly basis to confirm that instances where they have been lobbied on a particular matter, including the specific matter and date, have been registered. Where lobbying activity has not been disclosed, the public member shall first remind the lobbyist of the requirement to disclose and, should the activity remain undisclosed, advise the Integrity Commissioner of the failure to disclose.
1. Further, public members should ensure that individuals who are lobbying them are aware of their requirement to register as required under the requirements of the Lobbyist Registry. Public members should not knowingly communicate with a lobbyist who is acting in violation of the requirements of the Registry. If a public member is or at any time becomes aware that a person is in violation of the rules related to lobbying, the public member should either refuse to deal with the lobbyist or, where appropriate, either terminate the communication with the lobbyist at once or, if in the public member’s judgment it is appropriate to continue the communication, at the end of the communication, draw that person’s attention to the obligations imposed by the Registry and report the communication to the City Clerk and to the Integrity Commissioner.
1. Unless pre-approved by the Integrity Commissioner, the acceptance of any gift, benefit, or hospitality from lobbyists with active lobbying registrations or from their registered clients or their employees by public members of the Built Heritage Committee is prohibited.
1. The principle here is to ensure that companies and individuals who may be seeking to do business with the City do not do so by giving gifts or favours to people in a position to influence vendor approval or decision-making.

### Section 13 - Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality

1. Through their work on the Built Heritage Committee, public members are expected to provide advice and assistance to Committee and Council and to do so with both impartiality and objectivity. The acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality can imply favouritism, bias or influence on the part of the public member. At times, the acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality occurs as part of the social protocol or community events linked to the duties of a Committee of Council.
1. Public members shall not accept gifts that would, to a reasonable member of the public, appear to be in gratitude for influence, to induce influence, or otherwise to go beyond the necessary and appropriate public functions involved. For these purposes, a gift, benefit or hospitality provided with the public member’s knowledge to a public member’s spouse, child, or parent that is connected directly or indirectly to the performance of the public member’s duties is deemed to be a gift to that public member.
1. To enhance transparency and accountability with respect to gifts, benefits and hospitality, public members will file a quarterly disclosure statement that will be added to the public Gifts Registry. Public members are required to disclose all gifts, benefits, hospitality and sponsored travel received which individually exceed $100 from one source in a calendar year.
1. The disclosure statement must indicate:
  1. The nature of the gift, benefit or hospitality;
  1. Its source and date of receipt;
  1. The circumstances under which it was given or received;
  1. Its estimated value;
  1. What the recipient intends to do with the gift; and
  1. Whether the gift will at any point will be left with the City.
1. In the case of requirement (f) of the disclosure statement, those gifts received by public members which have significance or historical value for the City of Ottawa shall be left with City Archives at the end of a public member’s term on the Committee.

Acceptance of Event Tickets
1. The City of Ottawa is home to many types of festivals, community, cultural and sports events. The City is also the host site for many federal, provincial, National Capital Commission events. Consequently, public members of the Built Heritage Committee may be expected to attend or may be frequently encouraged to attend by being provided with tickets or invitations.
1. As with gifts, the acceptance of this kind of benefit can appear to be a means of undue influence. While the choice of venues and events they attend is entirely at the discretion of public members of the Built Heritage Committee, when accepting tickets as a gift or benefit, public members shall observe the following limits:
  1. To further enhance transparency all tickets of a value exceeding $30 shall be disclosed quarterly in the Gifts Registry, along with the disposition thereof (e.g. who attended with the public member, or if donated, to whom or what organization);
  1. A limit of two tickets for up to two events from one source in a calendar year is permitted and requires disclosure;
  1. Accepting any tickets for subsequent events from the same source is prohibited.
1. On receiving a disclosure statement, the Integrity Commissioner shall examine it to ascertain whether the receipt of the gift or benefit might, in their opinion, create a conflict between a private interest and the public duty of the public member or in consultation with the City Archivist whether the gift has significance or historical value for the City. In the event that the Integrity Commissioner makes that preliminary determination, they shall call upon the public member to justify receipt of the gift or benefit.
1. Should the Integrity Commissioner determine that receipt was inappropriate, they may direct the public member to return the gift or remit the value of any gift or benefit already consumed to the City.
1. The following are recognized as exceptions and do not require registration:
  1. compensation authorized by law;
  1. such gifts or benefits that normally accompany the responsibilities of office and are received as an incident of protocol or social obligation;
  1. a political contribution otherwise reported by law, in the case of members running for office;
  1. services provided without compensation by persons volunteering their time;
  1. a suitable memento of a function honouring the member;
  1. food, lodging, transportation and entertainment provided by provincial, regional and local governments or political subdivisions of them, by the federal government or by a foreign government within a foreign country, or by a conference, seminar or event organizer where the member is either speaking or attending in an official capacity;
  1. food and beverages consumed at banquets, receptions or similar events, if:
    1. attendance serves a legitimate business purpose;
    1. the person extending the invitation or a representative of the organization is in attendance; and
    1. the value is reasonable and the invitations infrequent;
  1. communication to a member, including subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals;
  1. sponsorships and donations for community events organized or run by a member or a third party on behalf of a member, subject to the limitations set in the Council Expense Policy;
  1. gifts of a nominal value (e.g. baseball cap, t-shirt, flash drive, book, etc.); and
  1. any other gift or personal benefit, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion it is unlikely that receipt of the gift or benefit gives rise to a reasonable presumption that the gift or benefit was given in order to influence the public member in the performance of their duties.
1. The Gifts Registry will be updated on a quarterly basis and posted on the City’s website for public viewing.

### Section 14 - Election-Related Activity

1. Public members of the Built Heritage Committee are required to conduct themselves in accordance with theMunicipal Elections Act, 1996and the City’sElection-Related Resources Policy. The use of municipal resources, both actual municipal property and staff time, for election-related activity is strictly prohibited. The prohibition applies to both the promotion and opposition to the candidacy of a person for elected office. Election-related activity applies not only to any public member’s personal campaign for office, but also other campaigns for municipal, provincial and federal office.
1. A public member shall not engage in political campaigning of any sort (municipally, provincially or federally) on behalf of the Committee or as a member of the Committee.

### Section 15 - Compliance with the Code of Conduct

1. Public members of the Built Heritage Committee are expected to adhere to the provisions of the Code of Conduct. TheMunicipal Act, 2001authorizes Council, where it has received a report by its Integrity Commissioner that, in their opinion, there has been a violation of the Code of Conduct, to impose either of the following sanctions:
  1. A reprimand.
  1. Suspension of the remuneration paid to the member in respect of their services as a member of Council or a local board, as the case may be, for a period of up to 90 days.
1. The Integrity Commissioner may also recommend that Council impose one of the following sanctions:
  1. Written or verbal public apology;
  1. Return of property or reimbursement of its value or of monies spent;
  1. Removal from membership of a committee; and
  1. Removal as chair of a committee.
1. The Integrity Commissioner has the final authority to recommend any of the sanctions above or other remedial action at their discretion.
