How to use this Appendix
This Appendix lists all of the amending by-laws to the City of Ottawa Zoning By-law, by by-law number, in descending numerical order, beginning with the most recently enacted by-laws.
The Appendix is updated on a regular basis, subsequent to every Council meeting where Ottawa City Council enacts zoning amendment or interim control by-laws.
For each amending by-law added to the Appendix, two links are provided in the amending by-law’s “Date By-law Enacted By Council” column. The links are to the “City Council & Committee Agendas & Minutes” Section of the City’s website, to the City Council meeting in which the amending by-law was enacted by Council.
One link is to the related zoning amendment report, which includes committee’s recommendation to City Council.
The second link is to the Disposition/Minutes of the relevant Council meeting, to allow users to determine how Council “disposed” of the amendment.
The status of each amendment is provided in the fourth column.
Copies of individual zoning amendment by-laws are available at the following locations:

Please Note
: This Appendix does not form part of the Zoning By-law, but is provided for reference purposes only. Although the Appendix is updated regularly, the amending provisions of individual amending by-laws are incorporated into the Consolidation’s text, schedules and zoning map, only upon an amendment coming into full force and effect, i.e. the amending by-law’s appeal period has expired and no appeals against the by-law have been received, or appeals were received and a decision to uphold the by-law has been received from the Ontario Land Tribunal.
