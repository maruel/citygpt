Schedule C – Allocation of authorized municipal properties
When a municipal property has been approved to host a clothing donation box in accordance with this by-law, the Director of By-Law and Regulatory Services will provide notice to the public and to clothing donation box permit holders of the intent to hold a lottery to allocate the available municipal property and to invite expressions of interest from parties who are interested in operating at the municipal property, in accordance with this process.
Notice from the Director shall include the following:
the name and address of the municipal property that is available for allocation;
contact information of the appropriate City staff person to respond to questions;
deadline for interested parties to respond indicating their interest to operate a clothing donation box at the available municipal property;
date that the lottery will occur;
date by which the clothing donation box must be installed at the municipal property;
the location of where the box must be installed on the property; and
the requirement for interested parties:
if there is more than one municipal property available, to confirm which property or properties they are interested in; and,
to hold or obtain a valid clothing donation box permit under this by-law from the City by the deadline date.
Notice in accordance with Section 2 will be provided through the City’s website, social media platforms, and by email to existing permit holders.
A successful candidate for an available municipal property shall be chosen as follows:
If only one municipal property is available and only one eligible permit holder has indicated interest in operating a clothing donation box at the municipal property, then there is no lottery, and the eligible permit holder is allocated the available municipal property.
If only one municipal property is available and there is more than one eligible permit holder interested, a lottery will be held to allocate the available municipal property. The Director will allocate the available municipal property to the eligible permit holder whose name is first selected through the lottery.
If more than one municipal property is available and there is only one eligible permit holder interested, then there is no lottery, and the eligible permit holder can select from the available municipal properties up to a maximum of three (3) properties, in accordance with Section 21 of this by-law.
If more than one municipal property is available and there is more than one eligible permit holder interested, then a lottery will be held as follows:
The Director will choose a municipal property to be allocated.
Only the names of the eligible permit holders who expressed interest in the municipal property will be included in the lottery for the allocation of that property.
The eligible permit holder whose name is first selected will be allocated the available municipal property indicated by the Director.
The same process will be applied until all available municipal properties for which interest has been expressed have been allocated.
When an eligible permit holder has been allocated three (3) municipal properties, their name will be removed from any subsequent allocations.
If an eligible permit holder who has already been allocated three (3) municipal properties has expressed interest in an available municipal property for which no other eligible permit holder has expressed interest, then the Director may allocate that property to the eligible permit holder.
If two or more eligible permit holders who have already been allocated three (3) municipal properties have expressed interest in an available municipal property for which there is no other interested eligible permit holder who has been allocated less than three (3) municipal properties, then a lottery shall be held to allocate the available municipal property. The Director will allocate the available municipal property to the eligible permit holder whose name is first selected by the lottery.
If no interest has been expressed for an available municipal property, the Director will allocate that property at a subsequent time on a first come-first-serve basis or through a subsequent lottery process at the discretion of the Director to an eligible permit holder who indicates an interest to the Director.
If a permit holder’s clothing donation box is removed from an approved municipal property for any reason, a subsequent lottery will be held for that property using the same process noted above.
In all cases, the lottery shall occur by means of an electronic random name generator software approved by the Director. Eligible permit holders will be invited to attend the lottery virtually or in-person at the Director’s discretion. The Director or his or her delegate shall be responsible for the administration of the lottery.
