The permit holder shall, prior to the commencement of any construction or demolition or placement of any materials or equipment, erect or cause to be erected and maintain a fence enclosing the site in accordance with this Part of the By-law, for the purpose of protecting the public by preventing entry and limiting the exposure to risk of injury due to hazards.
For the purposes of subsection 40(1), the scope of this Part includes the area of the proposed construction, alteration or demolition of any building, including any incomplete or abandoned building, any area where materials and equipment appurtenant to the site activity are located, as well as any area of extra hazard as determined by the Chief Building Official.
Conditions for exemption of fencing requirement in subsection 40(1):
where it can be demonstrated that the hazard to the public is minimal, including development sites of low human occupancy,
where all of the proposed construction or demolition is contained within an existing structure, and entry to the structure is limited,
where the construction or demolition has progressed to such a stage that the public no longer requires the protection of the fencing, or
where existing fencing is in place provided that it meets or exceeds the provisions of this by-law.
Section 41 - Protection of the public by fencing
Every fence required under Section 40(1) shall be erected in accordance with the following:
be located between the site and the public way or the open sides of a construction site to fully enclose the activity,
have an unobstructed fence height above grade when measured from outside the enclosure of at least:
1.8 m high for the construction, alteration or demolition activity of any type of building, that is located 3.0 m or less from a public way, or is adjacent to an area of extra hazard, or
1.2 m high for the construction, alteration or demolition activity of a residential building of no more than 3 storeys that is located more than 3.0 m from an adjacent public way, and
where the building or structure is located adjacent to a “public way” as defined by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chap. O.1, as amended, the “Public Way Protection” as required, may be constructed in addition to, or as part of, the required fencing, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 64 and 65 of O. Reg 213/91, as amended.
Fencing is deemed to comply with Section 40(1), if it is constructed in accordance with the following:
The fence material shall be not less than:
12.5 mm thick exterior grade plywood or wafer board or oriented strand board (OSB) fence, that is close-boarded,
Poly-Vinyl-Chloride (PVC) plastic mesh safety-fence type supported top and bottom,
galvanized chain link construction,
prefabricated modular fencing of welded metal frame with wire mesh infill, or
a combination of the above materials if it can achieve an equivalent performance level
the surface facing the exterior side of the enclosed area shall be smooth so as to deter climbing,
no openings through and under any part of the fence shall be of a size so as to prevent the passage of a spherical object having a diameter of 100mm, and
the fence shall be erected with adequate supports and maintained in a sturdy, upright condition such that the effective height of the protection is not reduced.
Every access opening in a fence shall be equipped with a gate that shall be:
constructed of materials equivalent to the performance of the fence,
identified clearly as the point of access into or exit from the site, and
securely closed and locked when the construction or demolition site is unattended.
Where any special hazard exists from which it is not possible to protect the public by means of fencing, the owner shall employ persons to guard the site and prevent the public from entering the danger zone at any time, day or night.
Section 42 - Removal of fencing
The fence installed to enclose the site shall be removed no more than thirty (30) days after the completion of the construction or demolition work.
Where the construction or demolition is substantially suspended or abandoned and the site no longer deemed unsafe by the Chief Building Official, the fence installed to enclose the site may be required to be removed by the Inspector.
Failure to remove the fence within ten (10) business days of receipt of a notice from the Inspector may result in the Chief Building Official arranging to remove the fence and all associated costs shall be invoiced to the owner and costs not recovered within 30 days of invoicing shall be tax rolled.
Subsections 42(1), (2) and (3) do not apply to a fence contemplated in subsection 40(3)(d).
