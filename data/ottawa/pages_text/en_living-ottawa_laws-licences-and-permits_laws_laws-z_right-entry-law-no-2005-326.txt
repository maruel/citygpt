Introduction
A by-law of the City of Ottawa authorizing entry upon adjoining lands for the purpose of making repairs or alterations to buildings, fences or other structures.
The Council of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:
Amendments
2009-259
Highlights
In order to gain authorization, a permit must be obtained.
Applications for permits must include identifying the work to be covered by the permit in detail, description of the land on which the work will take place, providing the names and contact information for the contractor performing the work, the address of the adjoining land and written authorization from the owner of the land (if applicant does not own land).
To apply for a Right of Entry Permit, call 3-1-1. A By-law officer will be assigned to inspect the property with you, and complete the necessary forms on your behalf.
The fee for a Right of Entry Permit is $250.00. An additional refundable deposit of at least $500 will be required. This deposit will be returned once the property is restored to the satisfaction of the City.
Section 1 – Definitions
In this by-law,
“building” means any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy;
“City” means the municipal corporation of the City of Ottawa or the geographic area of the City of Ottawa as the context requires;
“Council” means the Council of the City of Ottawa;
“Director” means the person occupying the position of Manager, By-law and Regulatory Services, in the Emergency and Protective Services Department of the City of Ottawa, or authorized representative.
(By-law No 2009-259)
“land” includes buildings; “owner” when used in relation to the land where the work is to be done means the registered owner of the land or a person authorized in writing by the registered owner of the land to act on the owner’s behalf for the purpose of filing an application under this by-law;
“permit” means written permission or authorization to enter upon adjoining land; and “reasonable notice” means written notice that is provided to the owner or occupant of adjoining land at least one (1) business day in advance of the entry and that specifies the reason for the entry and the day and time of the proposed entry.
Section 2 – Interpretation
In this by-law, a word interpreted in the singular number has a corresponding meaning when used in the plural.
It is declared that if any section, subsection or part or parts thereof be declared by any Court of Law to be bad, illegal or ultra vires, such section, subsection or part or parts shall be deemed to be severable and all parts hereof are declared to be separate and independent and enacted as such.
Nothing in this by-law shall authorize entry into a building.
Sections 3 to 6 – Application for a permit
Section 3
To obtain a permit, the owner of land shall file with the Director an application for a permit in writing on the prescribed form.
Section 4
The application shall:
identify and describe in detail the work to be covered by the permit for which an application is made;
describe the land on which the work is to be done, by a description that will readily identify and locate the building lot as well as the adjoining premises;
state the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owner and the contractor performing the work;
state the address of the adjoining property upon which permission to enter is sought;
be accompanied by the permit fee as prescribed by Section 6;
be accompanied by the deposit in cash prescribed by Section 5, as deemed necessary by the Director; and,
where the applicant is not the owner, be accompanied by written authorization of the owner.
Section 5
The Director shall establish the amount of the deposit, as deemed necessary by the Director, which, in his or her opinion, shall be sufficient to pay for the cost of restoring the adjoining land or adjacent building, fence or structure to the same condition it was prior to entry, but in no case shall the deposit be less than five hundred dollars ($500.00).
The City shall retain the deposit made under subsection (1), until the applicant has restored the adjoining land or adjacent building, fence or other structure to the satisfaction of the Director.
If the applicant fails to do such restoration to the satisfaction of the Director, then within thirty (30) days of providing written notice of such failure to the applicant, the deposit shall be forfeited and paid by the City to the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the land entered.
Section 6

Section 9
If adjoining land is damaged by the entry or by anything done on the land as a result of the entry, the owner or occupant shall restore the land as close to its original condition in so far as is practicable, and shall provide compensation for any damage caused by the entry or anything done to the adjoining land.
