Part II
Section 4 - General Integrity
Members of local boards are committed to performing their functions with integrity, accountability and transparency.
Members of local boards are responsible for complying with all applicable legislation, by-laws and policies pertaining to their position.
Members of local boards recognize that the public has a right to open government and transparent decision-making.
Members of local boards shall at all times serve and be seen to serve the interests of the City in a conscientious and diligent manner and shall approach decision-making with an open mind.
Members of local boards shall avoid the improper use of the influence of their position and shall avoid conflicts of interest, both apparent and real.
Members of local boards shall not extend in the discharge of their official duties preferential treatment to any individual or organization if a reasonably well-informed person would conclude that the preferential treatment was solely for the purpose of advanc­ing a private or personal interest.
Section 5 - Confidential Information
Members of local boards may acquire confidential information from a variety of different sources in the course of their work. Confidential information includes information in the possession of, or received in confidence by the local board, that the local board is either prohibited from disclosing, or is required to refuse to disclose under the
Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act
(“MFIPPA”).
Members of local boards shall not use information that is obtained in their capacity as a member, and that is not available to the general public, to further or seek to further the member’s private interest or to further or seek to further another person’s private interest.
Section 6 - Conduct at Local Board Meetings
Members of local boards shall conduct themselves with decorum at all local board meetings in accordance with the provisions of the local board’s procedure by-law (as required under Section 238 of the
Municipal Act, 2001
).
Section 7 - Discrimination and Harassment
All members of local boards have a duty to treat members of the public, one another and staff of the local board with respect and without abuse, bullying or intimidation, and to ensure that their work environment is free from discrimination and harassment. The
Ontario Human Rights Code
applies as well as any other applicable board policy on the matter.
Section 8 - Improper Use of Influence
Members of local boards are expected to perform their duties of office with integrity, accountability and transparency. Members of local boards should not use the status of their position to influence the decision of another individual to the private advantage of oneself, or one’s parents, children or spouse, staff members, friends, or associates, business or otherwise.
Section 9 - Use of Board Property and Resources
In order to fulfill their roles as appointed officials, members of local boards have access to board resources such as property, equipment, services, staff and supplies. No member of a local board shall use, or permit the use of such resources for activities other than purposes connected with the discharge of local board duties.
No member shall obtain financial gain from the use or sale of board-developed intellectual property, computer programs, technological innovations, or other patent, trademark, copyright held by the board.
Section 10 - Conduct Respecting Staff
Members shall be respectful of the role of staff of the local board, or City staff where applicable, to provide advice based on political neutrality and objectivity and without undue influence from an individual member of the local board or group of members.
Members should not:
Maliciously or falsely injure the professional or ethical reputation, or the prospects or practice of board staff;
Compel board staff to engage in partisan political activities or be subjected to threats or discrimination for refusing to engage in such activities; or
Use, or attempt to use, their authority or influence for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any board staff member with the intent of interfering in staff’s duties.
Section 11 - Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality
Members of local boards shall not accept gifts that would, to a reasonable member of the public, appear to be in grati­tude for influence, to induce influence, or otherwise to go beyond the necessary and appropriate public functions involved. For these purposes, a gift, benefit or hospitality provided with the member’s knowledge to a member’s spouse, child, or parent, that is connected directly or indirectly to the performance of the member’s duties is deemed to be a gift to that member.
To enhance transparency and accountability with respect to gifts, benefits, tickets to events and hospitality, members will file an annual disclosure statement that will be added to the public Gifts Registry. Members of local boards are required to disclose all gifts, benefits, hospitality, tickets to events and sponsored travel received which individually exceed $100 from one source in a calendar year.
The disclosure statement must indicate:
The nature of the gift, benefit, tickets to events or hospitality;
Its source and date of receipt;
The circumstances under which it was given or received;
Its estimated value;
What the recipient did with the gift; and
Whether the gift will at any point will be left with the local board or the City.
On receiving a disclosure statement, the Integrity Commissioner, shall examine it to ascertain whether the receipt of the gift, benefit, tickets to events or hospitality might, in his or her opinion, create a conflict between a private interest and the public duty of the member.
In the event that the Integrity Commissioner makes that preliminary determination, he or she shall call upon the Member to justify receipt of the gift or benefit.
Should the Integrity Commissioner determine that receipt was inappropriate, he or she may direct the Member to return the gift or remit the value of any gift or benefit already consumed to the City.
The following are recognized as exceptions and do not require registration:
compensation authorized by law;
such gifts, benefits tickets to events or hospitality that normally accompany the responsibilities of office and are received as an incident of protocol or social obligation;
a political contribution otherwise reported by law, in the case of members running for office;
services provided without compensation by persons volunteering their time;
a suitable memento of a function honouring the member;
food, lodging, transportation and entertainment provided by provincial, regional and local governments or political subdivisions of them, by the federal government or by a foreign government within a foreign country, or by a conference, seminar or event organizer where the member is either speaking or attending in an official capacity;
food and beverages consumed at banquets, receptions or similar events, if:
attendance serves a legitimate business purpose;
the person extending the invitation or a representative of the organization is in attendance; and
the value is reasonable and the invitations infrequent;
communications connected with the role of a member, including subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals;
gifts of a nominal value (e.g. baseball cap, t-shirt, flash drive, book, etc.); and
any other gift or personal benefit, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion it is unlikely that receipt of the gift or benefit gives rise to a reasonable presumption that the gift or benefit was given in order to influence the Member in the performance of his or her duties.
The Gifts Registry will be updated on an annual basis and posted on the City’s website for public viewing.
Section 12 - Election-Related Activity
Members of local boards are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the
Municipal Elections Act, 1996
and the local board’s policy regarding use of board resources during the election campaign period (as required under Section 88.18 of the
Municipal Elections Act, 1996
).
The use of board resources, both actual property and staff time, for election-related activity is strictly prohibited. The prohibition applies to both the promotion and opposition to the candidacy of a person for elected office. Election-related activity applies to campaigns for municipal, provincial and federal office.
Section 13 - Outside Activities
Members shall not be a director or hold an executive position with any organization whose objectives and mandates are in conflict with, or may reasonably be perceived to be in conflict with, the objectives and mandates of the local board. Before taking on a new executive position, the member shall inform the Chair of the local board and the Integrity Commissioner to obtain advice about the new circumstances.
Section 14 - Communications with Adjudicative Boards
Communications with members of an adjudicative board by a party or their representative must be through the board administrator and/or during the appropriate proceeding.
Written communications to the adjudicative board shall be made through the board administrator and shall be copied to all parties or their representatives as appropriate. Oral communications with the adjudicative board shall take place during formal proceedings of the adjudicative board and in the presence of all parties.
Section 15 - Independent Nature of Adjudicative Boards
Members of adjudicative boards operate at arms-length from and independently of City Council and the City administration. Members should maintain the board’s independence and ensure their actions are consistent with the arms-length, quasi-judicial nature of an adjudicative board.
Part III
Section 16 - Compliance with the Code of Conduct
Members of local boards are expected to adhere to the provisions of the Code of Conduct. The
Municipal Act, 2001
authorizes the local board, where it has received a report by its Integrity Commissioner that, in his or her opinion, there has been a violation of the Code of Conduct, to impose one of the following sanctions:
A reprimand; and
Suspension of the remuneration paid to the member in respect of his or her services as a member of a local board for a period of up to 90 days, where the member is remunerated as a member of the local board.
The Integrity Commissioner may also recommend that the local board impose one of the following sanctions:
Removal from membership of a committee of the local board;
Removal as chair of the local board or a committee of the local board;
Written or verbal public apology; and
Return of property or reimbursement of its value or of monies spent;
The Integrity Commissioner may also recommend that City Council revoke the member’s appointment to the local board.
The Integrity Commissioner has the final authority to recommend any of the sanctions above or other remedial action at his or her discretion.
Section 17 - Short Title
This By-law may be referred to as the “Code of Conduct for Members of Local Boards”.
Section 18 - Effective Date
This by-law shall be effective as of March 1, 2019.
ENACTED AND PASSED on the 12th day of December 2018.
