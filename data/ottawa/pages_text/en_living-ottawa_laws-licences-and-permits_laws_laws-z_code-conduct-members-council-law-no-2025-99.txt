Part II
Section 4 - General Integrity
Members of Council are committed to performing their functions with integrity, accountability and transparency.
Members of Council are responsible for complying with all applicable legislation, by-laws and policies pertaining to their position as an elected official.
Members of Council recognize that the public has a right to open government and transparent decision-making.
Members of Council shall at all times serve and be seen to serve the interests of their constituents and the City in a conscientious and diligent manner and shall approach decision-making with an open mind.
Members shall avoid the improper use of the influence of their office and shall avoid conflicts of interest, both apparent and real.
Members shall file a disclosure statement with the Integrity Commissioner, in the form provided by the Integrity Commissioner, within 60 days of being elected and annually thereafter. The statement shall disclose the Member’s private interests, and the private interests of the Member’s parent(s), spouse, or child(ren).
Members of Council shall not extend in the discharge of their official duties preferential treatment to any individual or organization if a reasonably well-informed person would conclude that the preferential treatment was solely for the purpose of advanc­ing a private or personal interest.
For greater clarity, this Code does not prohibit members of Council from prop­erly using their influence on behalf of constituents.
Section 5 - Confidential Information
By way of their office, Members of Council acquire confidential information from a variety of different sources including confidential personal information related to constituents who have contacted their office. Confidential information includes information in the possession of, or received in confidence by the City, that the City is either prohibited from disclosing, or is required to refuse to disclose under the
Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act
(“MFIPPA”). Members of Council shall not use information that is obtained in their capacity as a Member and that is not available to the general public to further or seek to further the member’s private interest or improperly to further or seek to further another person’s private interest.
In accordance with the rules under MFIPPA and the
Procedure By-law
, Members of Council shall not:
Where a matter has been discussed
in camera
, and where the matter remains confidential, disclose the content of the matter or the substance of the deliberations of the
in camera
meeting (Subsection 42 (1) (d) of the
Procedure By-law
); and
Disclose or release by any means to any member of the public, any confidential information acquired by virtue of their office, in either oral or written form, except when required by law or authorized by Council to do so.

Section 7 - Discrimination and Harassment
All members of Council have a duty to treat members of the public, one another and staff with respect and without abuse, bullying or intimidation, and to ensure that their work environment is free from discrimination and harassment. The Ontario Human Rights Code applies and, where applicable, the City’s
Workplace Violence and Harassment Policy
.
Section 8 - Improper Use of Influence
As an elected official, Members of Council are expected to perform their duties of office with integrity, accountability and transparency. Members of Council should not use the status of their position to influence the decision of another individual to the private advantage of oneself, or one’s parents, children or spouse, staff members, friends, or associates, business or otherwise.
In the same manner, and as outlined in the Provincial Offences Act – Conflict of Interest Policy, Members of Council shall not attempt to influence or interfere, either directly or indirectly, financially, politically or otherwise with employees, officers or other persons performing duties under the Provincial Offences Act and any administrative monetary penalty proceedings as outlined in the Administrative Penalty System – Political Interference Policy.
Section 9 - Use of Municipal Property and Resources
In order to fulfill their roles as elected representatives, Members of Council have access to municipal resources such as property, equipment, services, staff and supplies. No member of Council shall use, or permit the use of City land, facilities, equipment, supplies, services, staff or other resources (for example, City-owned materials, websites, or a Member of Council Constituency Services Budget) for activities other than purposes connected with the discharge of Council duties or City business.
No Member shall obtain financial gain from the use or sale of City-developed intellectual property, computer programs, technological innovations, or other patent, trademark, copyright held by the City.
Section 10 - Conduct Respecting Staff
The
Municipal Act, 2001
sets out the roles of Members of Council and the municipal administration, including specific roles for statutory officers such as the Chief Administrative Officer, Clerk, Treasurer, Auditor General and the Integrity Commissioner.
Members of Council are expected to:
represent the public and to consider the well-being and interests of the municipality;
develop and evaluate the policies and programs of the municipality;
determine which services the municipality provides;
ensure that administrative policies, practices and procedures and controllership policies, practices and procedures are in place to implement the decisions of council;
ensure the accountability and transparency of the operations of the municipality, including the activities of the senior management of the municipality;
maintain the financial integrity of the municipality; and
carry out the duties of council under the
Municipal Act, 2001
or any other Act.
The Mayor, as head of council, is granted powers and duties under Part VI.1 of the Municipal Act, 2001. These powers include the authority to direct City staff, in writing, to:
undertake research and provide advice to the head of council and the municipality on policies and programs of the municipality or of the head of council as they relate to the powers and duties under Part VI.1; and
carry out duties related to the exercise of the power or performance of the duty, including implementing any decisions made by the head of council under Part VI.1.
The municipal administration is expected to:
implement council’s decisions and establish administrative practices and procedures to carry out council’s decisions;
undertake research and provide advice to council on the policies and programs of the municipality; and
carry out other duties required under the
Municipal Act, 2001
or any Act and other duties assigned by the municipality.
Except for the Mayor (as authorized under Part VI.1 of the
Municipal Act, 2001
), City Council as a whole has the authority to approve budget, policy, governance and other such matters. Under the direction of the City Manager, city staff, and the staff of the Offices of the Auditor General and the Integrity Commissioner, serves Council as a whole and the combined interests of all members as evidenced through the decisions of Council.
Members of Council shall be respectful of the role of the municipal administration to provide advice based on political neutrality and objectivity and without undue influence from an individual Member (except for the Mayor as authorized under Part VI.1 of the
Municipal Act, 2001
) or group of Members of Council.
Members of Council should not:
Maliciously or falsely injure the professional or ethical reputation, or the prospects or practice of municipal staff;
Compel municipal staff to engage in partisan political activities or be subjected to threats or discrimination for refusing to engage in such activities; or
Use, or attempt to use, their authority or influence for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any municipal staff member with the intent of interfering in staff’s duties.
Section 11 - Expenses
Members of Council are provided with a Constituency Services Budget with which to run their offices. Expenses include items such as: community events, contributions and sponsorship, office supplies and staffing. The
Council Expense Policy
outlines the specifics of how expenses, contributions and sponsorships are to be handled and disclosed.
Members of Council are required to:
adhere to the
Council Expense Policy
and related procedures and guidelines and ensure that conditions related to each expense are met; and
ensure the management of their offices is undertaken in accordance with all applicable policies and procedures.
Falsifying of receipts or signatures by a Member of Council or their staff is a serious breach of this Code of Conduct and the
Criminal Code of Canada
and could lead to prosecution.
Section 12 - Conduct Respecting Lobbying
Members of Council, as public office holders, are routinely approached by various individuals attempting to influence decisions before Council or under the delegated authority of the Ward Councillor. While lobbying is an acceptable practice, disclosure of lobbying activities enhances the transparency and integrity of City business.
In accordance with the City’s Lobbyist Registry, Members of Council shall review the Lobbyist Registry on a monthly basis to confirm that instances where they have been lobbied on a particular matter, including the specific matter and date, have been registered. Where lobbying activity has not been disclosed, the Member shall first remind the lobbyist of the requirement to disclose and, should the activity remain undisclosed, advise the Integrity Commissioner of the failure to disclose.
Further, Members of Council should ensure that individuals who are lobbying them are aware of their requirement to register as required under the requirements of the Lobbyist Registry. Members of Council should not knowingly communicate with a lobbyist who is acting in violation of the requirements of the Registry. If a Member of Council is or at any time becomes aware that a person is in violation of the rules related to lobbying, the Member should either refuse to deal with the lobbyist or, where appropriate, either terminate the communication with the lobbyist at once or, if in the Member’s judgment it is appropriate to continue the communication, at the end of the communication, draw that person’s attention to the obligations imposed by the Registry and report the communication to the City Clerk and to the Integrity Commissioner.
Unless pre-approved by the Integrity Commissioner, the acceptance of any gift, benefit, or hospitality from lobbyists with active lobbying registrations or from their registered clients or their employees by Members of Council or their staff is prohibited.
The principle here is to ensure that companies and individuals who may be seeking to do business with the City do not do so by giving gifts or favours to people in a position to influence vendor approval or decision-making.
The acceptance of sponsorships for events supported or organized by Members of Council is governed by the
Community, Fundraising and Special Events Policy
.
Section 13 - Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality
Members of Council are expected to represent the public and the interests of the municipality and to do so with both impartiality and objectivity. The acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality can imply favouritism, bias or influence on the part of the Member. At times, the acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality occurs as part of the social protocol or community events linked to the duties of an elected official and their role in representing the municipality.
Members of Council shall not accept gifts that would, to a reasonable member of the public, appear to be in grati­tude for influence, to induce influence, or otherwise to go beyond the necessary and appropriate public functions involved. For these purposes, a gift, benefit or hospitality provided with the Member’s knowledge to a Member’s spouse, child, or parent, or to a Member’s staff that is connected directly or indirectly to the performance of the Member’s duties is deemed to be a gift to that Member.
To enhance transparency and accountability with respect to gifts, benefits and hospitality, Members of Council will file a quarterly disclosure statement that will be added to a public Gifts Registry. Members of Council are required to disclose all gifts, benefits, hospitality and sponsored travel received which individually exceed $100 from one source in a calendar year.
The disclosure statement must indicate:
The nature of the gift, benefit or hospitality;
Its source and date of receipt;
The circumstances under which it was given or received;
Its estimated value;
What the recipient intends to do with the gift; and
Whether the gift will at any point will be left with the City.
In the case of requirement (f) of the disclosure statement, those gifts received by Members of Council which have significance or historical value for the City of Ottawa shall be left with City Archives when the Member ceases to hold office.
Acceptance of Event Tickets
The City of Ottawa is home to many types of festivals, community, cultural and sports events. The City is also the host site for many federal, provincial, National Capital Commission events. Consequently, Members of Council are often expected to attend or are frequently encouraged to attend by being provided with tickets or invitations.
As with gifts, the acceptance of this kind of benefit can appear to be a means of undue influence. While the choice of venues and events they attend is entirely at the discretion of Members of Council, when accepting tickets as a gift or benefit, Members of Council shall observe the following limits:
To further enhance transparency all tickets of a value exceeding $30 shall be disclosed quarterly in the Gifts Registry, along with the disposition thereof (e.g. who attended with the Member, or if donated, to whom or what organization).
A limit of two tickets for up to two events from one source in a calendar year is permitted and requires disclosure;
Accepting any tickets for subsequent events from the same source is prohibited.
On receiving a disclosure statement, the Integrity Commissioner, shall examine it to ascertain whether the receipt of the gift or benefit might, in their opinion, create a conflict between a private interest and the public duty of the Member or in consultation with the City Archivist whether the gift has significance or historical value for the City.
In the event that the Integrity Commissioner makes that preliminary determination, they shall call upon the Member to justify receipt of the gift or benefit.
Should the Integrity Commissioner determine that receipt was inappropriate, they may direct the Member to return the gift or remit the value of any gift or benefit already consumed to the City.
The following are recognized as exceptions and do not require registration:
compensation authorized by law;
such gifts or benefits that normally accompany the responsibilities of office and are received as an incident of protocol or social obligation;
a political contribution otherwise reported by law, in the case of members running for office;
services provided without compensation by persons volunteering their time;
a suitable memento of a function honouring the member;
food, lodging, transportation and entertainment provided by provincial, regional and local governments or political subdivisions of them, by the federal government or by a foreign government within a foreign country, or by a conference, seminar or event organizer where the member is either speaking or attending in an official capacity;
food and beverages consumed at banquets, receptions or similar events, if:
attendance serves a legitimate business purpose;
the person extending the invitation or a representative of the organization is in attendance; and
the value is reasonable and the invitations infrequent;
communication to the offices of a member, including subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals;
sponsorships and donations for community events organized or run by a Member or a third party on behalf of a member, subject to the limitations set in the Council Expense Policy;
gifts of a nominal value (e.g. baseball cap, t-shirt, flash drive, book, etc.); and
any other gift or personal benefit, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion it is unlikely that receipt of the gift or benefit gives rise to a reasonable presumption that the gift or benefit was given in order to influence the Member in the performance of their duties.
The Gifts Registry will be updated on a quarterly basis and posted on the City’s website for public viewing.
Section 14 - Election-Related Activity
Members of Council are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 and the City’s Election-Related Resources Policy. The use of municipal resources, both actual municipal property and staff time, for election-related activity is strictly prohibited. The prohibition applies to both the promotion and opposition to the candidacy of a person for elected office. Election-related activity applies not only to a Member’s personal campaign for office, but also other campaigns for municipal, provincial and federal office.
Part III
Section 15 - Compliance with the Code of Conduct
Members of Council are expected to adhere to the provisions of the Code of Conduct. The
Municipal Act, 2001
authorizes Council, where it has received a report by its Integrity Commissioner that, in their opinion, there has been a violation of the
Code of Conduct
, to impose one of the following sanctions:
A reprimand; and
Suspension of the remuneration paid to the member in respect of their services as a member of Council or a local board, as the case may be, for a period of up to 90 days.
The Integrity Commissioner may also recommend that Council impose one of the following sanctions:
Written or verbal public apology;
Return of property or reimbursement of its value or of monies spent;
Removal from membership of a committee; and
Removal as chair of a committee.
The Integrity Commissioner has the final authority to recommend any of the sanctions above or other remedial action at their discretion.
Section 16 - Repeal
By-law No. 2018-400 entitled “A by-law of the City of Ottawa to establish a code of conduct for Members of Council”, as amended, is hereby repealed.
Section 17 - Short Title
This By-law may be referred to as the “Code of Conduct for Members of Council”.

With the consent of both the complaining individual and the Member, the Integrity Commissioner may participate in any informal process. The parties involved are encouraged to take advantage of the Integrity Commissioner’s potential role as a mediator/conciliator of issues relating to a complaint. However, the informal process is not a precondition or a prerequisite to pursuing the formal complaint procedure outlined in Part II.
Appendix "A" Complaint Protocol: Part II - Formal Complaint Procedure

Designated City officials may refer a complaint to the Integrity Commissioner in accordance with the process set out in the relevant City policy.
The Integrity Commissioner may make accommodations for any participant in this process, as the Integrity Commissioner determines is necessary.
Section 4 - Filing of Complaint and Classification by Integrity Commissioner
The complaint shall be filed with the Integrity Commissioner for initial classification to determine if the matter is, on its face, a complaint with respect to non-compliance with the Code of Conduct and not covered by other legislation or other Council policies as described in Section 5.
If the complaint does not include a supporting affidavit, the Integrity Commissioner may defer the classification until an affidavit is received.
If the complaint concerns alleged harassment and the individual who filed the complaint is not the individual alleged to have experienced the harassment, the Integrity Commissioner may exercise their discretion to speak with the individual alleged to have experienced the harassment to inform them of the allegations and to verify the particulars of the allegations.
Section 5 - Complaints Outside Integrity Commissioner Jurisdiction
If the complaint, including any supporting affidavit, is not, on its face, a complaint with respect to non-compliance with the Code of Conduct or the complaint is covered by other legislation or complaint procedure under another Council policy, the Integrity Commissioner shall advise the complainant in writing as follows:
Criminal Matter
(a) If the complaint on its face is an allegation of a criminal nature consistent with the
Criminal Code of Canada
, the complainant shall be advised that if the complainant wishes to pursue any such allegation, the complainant must pursue it with the appropriate Police Service.

The Integrity Commissioner shall report to Council semi-annually during the first year, and annually thereafter. In their report to Council, they shall report on all complaints received and, on their disposition, (including complaints deemed not to be within the jurisdiction of the Integrity Commissioner).

The Integrity Commissioner may refuse to investigate a complaint or may terminate an investigation, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion that:
(a) ​​​​​​​there are no grounds or insufficient grounds for an investigation;
(b) the complaint is frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith; or
(c) an investigation, or continuation of an investigation, would serve no useful purpose.
Section 8 - Opportunities for Resolution
Following receipt and review of a formal complaint, or at any time during the investigation, where the Integrity Commissioner believes that an opportunity to resolve the matter may be successfully pursued without a formal investigation, and both the complainant and the Member agree, efforts may be pursued to achieve an informal resolution.
The Integrity Commissioner may also decide during an investigation that complaints relating to the following matters may not be Code of Conduct issues and may more appropriately be dealt with through other channels. With the consent of the complainant, the Integrity Commissioner may refer complaints as follows:
Formal complaints related to the interaction of municipal staff and Members of Council may be handled by the City Manager and the City Clerk, in consultation with the Mayor’s Office.
Formal complaints pertaining to matters involving current and former Councillors’ Assistants may be handled by the City Clerk.
Formal complaints concerning matters between one or more Members of Council may be handled by the Finance and Corporate Services Committee.

May provide a copy of the response, or portions thereof, to the complainant with a request for a written reply within ten business days.
If necessary, after reviewing the submitted materials, the Integrity Commissioner may speak to anyone, access and examine any other documents or electronic materials and may enter any City work location relevant to the complaint for the purpose of investigation and potential resolution.
A Member who is the subject of an inquiry may consult with a lawyer. If the complaint is dismissed or no contravention is found, the Member may charge the applicable expenses to their Constituency Services Budget. If a contravention is found, the Integrity Commissioner may determine that the applicable expenses will not be reimbursed by the City. After an inquiry has concluded, the Integrity Commissioner will disclose their determination to the Member, and the City Clerk as appropriate
.
The Integrity Commissioner may make interim reports to Council where necessary and as required to address any instances of interference, obstruction, delay or retaliation encountered during the investigation.
If the Integrity Commissioner has not completed an investigation before Nomination Day for a regular election, as set out in the
Municipal Elections Act, 1996
, the Integrity Commissioner shall terminate the inquiry on that day.

Section 12 - Member not Blameworthy
If the Integrity Commissioner determines that there has been no contravention of the Code of Conduct or that a contravention occurred although the Member took all reasonable measures to prevent it, or that a contravention occurred that was trivial or committed through inadvertence or an error of judgment made in good faith, the Integrity Commissioner may so state in the report and may make appropriate recommendations pursuant to the
Municipal Act, 2001
.
