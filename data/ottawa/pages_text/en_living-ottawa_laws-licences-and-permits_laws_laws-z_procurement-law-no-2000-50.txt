Section 20 - Purchases exceeding $125,000 - Request for proposal (2006-276, 2014-443, 2025-33)
A Request for Proposal should be used where one or more of the criteria for issuing a Request for Tender cannot be met, such as:
owing to the nature of the requirement, suppliers are invited to propose a solution to a problem, requirement or objective and the selection of the supplier is based on the effectiveness of the proposed solution rather than on price alone, or

Section 21 - Standing offer purchases
A Request for Standing Offer may be used where:
one or more clients repetitively order the same goods or services and the actual demand is not known in advance, or
a need is anticipated for a range of goods, services and construction for a specific purpose, but the actual demand is not known at the outset, and delivery is to be made when a requirement arises.
Supply Services shall establish and maintain Standing Offers that define source and price with selected suppliers for all frequently used goods or services.
To establish prices and select sources, Supply Services shall employ the provisions contained in this by-law for the acquisition of goods, services and construction.
More than one supplier may be selected where it is in the best interests of the City and the bid solicitation allows for more than one.
In circumstances where competition results in a large number of offers from vendors, which offers exceed the needs of the City, Supply Services is authorized to approach the highest ranked vendors to negotiate lower unit rates for the goods or services in return for a reduction in the number of firms authorized to provide the goods or services or the offer of a firm contractual commitment by the City.  (2008-427)
Where purchasing action is initiated by a Department for frequently used goods or services for which a standing offer is in place and the value of the purchasing action exceeds $4,000, it is to be made with the supplier or suppliers listed in the Standing Offer.  (2006-276, 2010-291, 2014-443, 2025-33)
In a Request for Standing Offer, the expected quantity of the specified goods or services to be purchased over the time period of the agreement will be as accurate an estimate as practical and be based, to the extent possible, on previous usage adjusted for any known factors that may change usage.
A call-up against a standing offer is considered to be an individual contract, and the normal contract award prescribed limits apply, unless otherwise stated in the original approval document.
Despite subsection (7) and Section 17, City staff, as designated by the Chief Procurement Officer, may issue call-ups to a maximum of $150,000 from a standing offer provided that the purchase is properly authorized by the Director, is consistent with the intent, terms, specifications and conditions of the standing offer and all other requirements of this by-law are complied with. (2003-373, 2004-565, 2014-443, 2017-362)
A call-up against a standing offer may be made in an amount to a maximum of $150,000 and exceptions to this maximum amount may be made by Supply Services, where it is of the opinion that there is a financial advantage to be achieved by the City.

Section 22 - Non-competitive purchases
Subject to section 5(6)(c) and section 17(6), the requirement for competitive bid solicitation for goods, services and construction may be waived under joint authority of the appropriate Director and Supply Services and replaced with negotiations by the Director and Supply Services under the following circumstances (2025-33):
where competition is precluded due to the application of any Act or legislation or because of the existence of patent rights, copyrights, technical secrets or controls of raw material,
where due to abnormal market conditions, the goods, services or construction required are in short supply,
where only one source of supply would be acceptable and cost effective,
where there is an absence of competition for technical or other reasons and the goods, services or construction can only be supplied by a particular supplier and no alternative exists,
where the nature of the requirement is such that it would not be in the public interest to solicit competitive bids as in the case of security or confidentiality matters,
[REPEALED – 2025-33]
[REPEALED – 2025-33]
where the total estimated project cost for professional services does not exceed $100,000, (2001-72, 2025-33)
where the requirement is for goods, services or construction for which there exists a statutory monopoly, (2025-33)
where additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods or services that were not included in the initial procurement if a change of supplier for such additional goods or services:
cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement; and
would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs. (2021-26)
for goods and services, where the supplier is a social enterprise owned by a non-profit organization or registered charity. (2021-344)
When a Director intends to select a supplier to provide goods, services or construction pursuant to subsection 22(1) that exceeds $25,000 in value, Supply Services is to be advised in writing of the compelling rationale that warrants a noncompetitive selection for approval. (2025-33)
The supplier in whom the Director and Supply Services have the greatest confidence to fulfill the requirement and provides for fair market value shall be selected.
The Director and Supply Services may jointly award a contract emanating from negotiations, including that for which no competitive bids were solicited, provided that:
the funds are available in appropriate accounts within the Departmental estimates approved by Council including authorized revisions to meet the proposed expenditure, (2014-443)
the amount of the contract does not exceed $125,000 except in the case of goods, services or construction for which there exists a statutory monopoly, (2025-33) and
the Director and Supply Services are both satisfied the contract represents fair market value.
Non-competitive awards require General Manager
and Supply Services approval where greater than $125,000. (2004-565, 2017-362, 2025-33)
The Director shall follow the provisions of Section 31 regarding the use of an agreement or Purchase Order.
Any non-competitive contract that does not satisfy the provisions of subsection (1) is subject to the City Manager’s approval.
Despite any other provision of this by-law, the Director Infrastructure Services (2010-291, 2017-362) and Supply Services may jointly award a contract for which no competitive bids were solicited provided that,
the contract is to complete outstanding works in approved plans of subdivision or site plans, and
the City holds sufficient funds as security to complete the works or the subdivision or site plan agreement contains provisions to recover the costs from the developer.
The relevant details surrounding the application of subsections (1) and (8) shall be included in the report submitted to Council pursuant to Section 39. (2006-276)
Section 23 -
Non-Competitive Special Circumstance Purchases (2025-33)
When a Director is of the opinion that a “Special Circumstance” to warrant a non-competitive purchase exists, the Director may authorize the purchase of such goods, services and construction as is considered necessary to remedy the situation without regard to the requirement for a bid solicitation and may award the necessary contract provided that the contract does not exceed $125,000. (2025-33)
Where the extent or the severity of the “Special Circumstance” to warrant a sole source purchase is such that the expenditure is likely to be in excess of $125,000, the General Manager may award the necessary contracts for the purchase of such goods, services and construction as is considered necessary to remedy the situation without regard to the requirement for a bid solicitation provided that the City Manager is satisfied that adequate funds may be appropriated from accounts within the Council approved estimates. (2004-565, 2025-33)
The relevant details surrounding the application of subsection 23(1) and (2) shall be included in the report submitted to Council pursuant to Section 39.
Section 24 - Follow-on non-competitive contracts
Where a reasonable likelihood exists that, on completion of a Contract, it will be necessary to award a follow-on Contract for goods or services to the existing supplier, Supply Services shall ensure that the possibility of a follow-on Contract will be identified in the original bid solicitation. (2008-427)
All requests for Proposal documents for Professional Services shall include wording that the hourly, per diem or other unit rates offered by the proponent will apply for the initial Contract award and any follow-on Contract. (2008-427, 2025-33)
Section 25 - Unsolicited proposals
Unsolicited Proposals received by the City shall be reviewed by the Director and Supply Services.
Any procurement activity resulting from the receipt of an Unsolicited Proposal shall comply with the provisions of this by-law and the separate Ottawa Option Policy for Unsolicited Proposals as approved by City Council on October 23, 2002. (2006-276)
A contract resulting from an Unsolicited Proposal shall be awarded on a non-competitive basis only when the procurement complies with the requirements of a non-competitive procurement.
Section 26 - Contract without budgetary appropriation
Where a requirement exists to initiate a project for which goods, services or construction are required and funds are not contained in appropriate accounts within the Council approved branch estimates to meet the proposed expenditure, the Director shall, prior to the commencement of the purchasing process, submit a report to Council containing:
information surrounding the requirement to contract,
the terms of reference to be provided in the contract, and
information on the availability of the funds within existing estimates, which were originally approved by Council for other purposes or on the requirement for additional funds.
Section 27 - Bid and contract administration
Bids shall only be accepted in electronic form as stipulated in the procurement solicitation document, ensuring confidentiality and security including maintaining the “sealed” nature of bids as long as necessary where required.  Bids will only be accepted by facsimile or paper form when so stipulated in the procurement solicitation document, and subject to Supply Services having in place appropriate arrangements for receipt thereof.
(2023-4)
Section 28 - No acceptable bid or equal bids received
Where bids are received in response to a bid solicitation but exceed budget, are not responsive to the requirement or do not represent fair market value, a revised solicitation shall be issued in an effort to obtain an acceptable bid unless subsection 28 (2) applies.
The Director and Supply Services jointly may waive the need for a revised bid solicitation and enter negotiations with the lowest responsive bidder or the highest responsive bidder for a revenue-driven bid selection emanating from a bid solicitation under the following circumstances:
the total cost of the lowest responsive bid is in excess of the funds appropriated by Council for the project or the Departmental highest responsive bid revenue is less than that made in appropriate accounts in the Council approved Departmental estimates, (2014- 443) and
the Director and Supply Services agree that the changes required to achieve an acceptable bid will not change the general nature of the requirement described in the bid solicitation.
The method of negotiation shall be those accepted as standard negotiating procedures that employ ethical practices.
In the case of building construction contracts, where the total cost of the lowest responsive bid is in excess of the appropriation made by Council, negotiations shall be made in accordance with the guidelines established by the Canadian Construction Documents Committee.
If two equal bids are received, a means of breaking the tie consistent with the provisions of the solicitation shall be employed.
Factors to be considered in breaking the tie include:
prompt payment discount,
when delivery is an important factor, the bidder offering the best delivery date be given preference,
a bidder in a position to better after sales service, with a good record in this regard, be given preference,
a bidder with an overall satisfactory performance record be given preference over a bidder known to have an unsatisfactory performance record,
a local bidder be given preference over a non-local bidder. (2010-291)
Section 29 - Guarantees of contract execution and performance
The Director and Supply Services may require that a bid be accompanied by a Bid Bond or other similar security to guarantee entry into a contract.
In addition to the security referred to in Subsection 29(1), the successful supplier may be required to provide,
a Performance Bond to guarantee the faithful performance of the contract, and
a Payment Bond to guarantee the payment for labour and materials to be supplied in connection with the contract.
The Director and Supply Services shall select the appropriate means to guarantee execution and performance of the contract. Means may include one or more of, but are not limited to, financial bonds or other forms of security deposits, provisions for liquidated damages, progress payments, and holdbacks.
Prior to commencement of work and where deemed appropriate, evidence of Liability Insurance Coverage satisfactory to the Chief Procurement Officer must be obtained, ensuring indemnification of the City of Ottawa from any and all claims, demands, losses, costs or damages resulting from the performance of a supplier’s obligations under the contract. (2004-565, 2017-362)
Prior to payment to a supplier, a Certificate of Clearance from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board shall be obtained ensuring all premiums or levies have been paid to the Board to date.
The Director and Supply Services shall ensure that the guarantee means selected will:
not be excessive but sufficient to cover financial risks to the City,
provide flexibility in applying leverage on a supplier so that the penalty is proportional to the deficiencies, and
comply with provincial statutes and regulations.
Financial bonds for contract performance shall only be required where the City will be exposed to costs if the contractor does not complete the requirements of the contract.
If the risk to the City is not adequately limited by the progress payment provisions of the contract, a minimum payment holdback of 10% shall be mandatory on all contracts exceeding $50,000. (2025-33)
Supply Services may release the holdback funds on construction contracts upon:
the contractor submitting a statutory declaration that all accounts have been paid and that all documents have been received for all damage claims,
receipt of clearance from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board for any arrears of Workplace Safety and Insurance Board assessment,
all the requirements of the Construction Act being satisfied, (2025-33)
receipt of certification from the City Solicitor, where applicable, that liens have not been registered, (2004-565, 2021-26) and
certification from the Director, under whom the work has been performed, that the conditions of the contract have been satisfied.

A formal agreement is to be used when the resulting contract is complex and will contain terms and conditions other than the City’s standard terms and conditions
It shall be the responsibility of the Director with Supply Services and/or the City Solicitor to determine if it is in the best interest of the City to establish a formal agreement with the supplier. (2004-565, 2021-26)
Where it is determined that Subsection 31(4) is to apply, the City Solicitor or Chief Procurement Officer shall conduct an initial review to determine if the agreement is significant, in which case they shall review and, provided the Director is in agreement with its terms, initial the agreement as “Approved for Execution” prior to final execution by authorized signing officers of the City. For agreements not deemed significant, the Director may elect to proceed with finalizing the agreement without a comprehensive legal review. (2004-565, 2016-374, 2021-26, 2025-33)
Where a formal agreement is required, as a result of the award of a contract by delegated authority, the Director shall execute the agreement in the name of The City of Ottawa.
Where a formal agreement is issued, Supply Services shall issue a Purchase Order incorporating the formal agreement.
Where a formal agreement is not required, Supply Services shall issue a Purchase Order incorporating the terms and conditions relevant to the award of contract.
A letter of award is to be used when the resulting contract is straightforward, contains the City’s standard terms and conditions and a purchase order will not be issued at time of award.
(2023-4)
Section 32 - Exercise of contract renewal options
Where a contract contains an option for renewal, the Director may authorize Supply Services to exercise such option provided that:

the Director and Supply Services agree that the exercise of the option is in the best interest of the City, and
funds are available in appropriate accounts within the Council approved estimates including authorized revisions to meet the proposed expenditure.

Supply Services and the Director agree that based on market conditions or an analysis of future conditions cost savings or cost avoidance can be obtained by a renewal; and
the supplier’s performance and vendor relations with the supplier have both exceeded the requirements of the Contract.
The authorization of the Director pursuant to subsections (1) or (2) shall include a written explanation of why the renewal is in the best interest of the City and shall include comments on the market situation and trends.
Inflationary increases for Contract renewal shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the Statistics Canada annual Consumer Price Index unless, the supplier can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Supply Services, that the supplier’s costs have increased significantly from the original Contract price and the supplier’s cost increases can be independently verified by the City.  (2008-427)

Any approval pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) will be recorded in the contract file and a revised purchase order will be prepared. ( 2008-427)
Section 46 - Comprehensive complaints process
The Chief Procurement Officer and/or the City's contact person identified in a procurement process will be the only official points of contact for a complaint.
Bidders shall not contact either elected representatives or other staff regarding the complaint when the comprehensive complaints process is engaged.
The City’s Comprehensive Complaints Process consists of four phases as follows:
Phase One: Mandatory Bidder Debriefing:
Within five business days from the date upon which a bidder is informed that they have not been selected as the winning bidder, an unsuccessful bidder has the right to submit a written request for a formal debriefing from the contract authority responsible for the procurement at issue.
The City commits to providing a formal debriefing within five business days of having received such a request.
The purpose of the mandatory debriefing is to provide an unsuccessful bidder with an opportunity to learn why their bid was not selected for contract award.
If the bidder remains dissatisfied after the debriefing, the bidder has an additional ten business days to prepare and file a formal complaint.
The City will not consider a formal complaint from an unsuccessful bidder if they have not first sought and attended a bidder debriefing.
Phase Two: Preliminary Screening:
A formal complaint must be made in writing and addressed to the Chief Procurement Officer.
The complaint should contain the identity of the complainant and the procurement process at issue as well as a clear and detailed statement of the legal and/or factual grounds upon which the complaint is based.
The complaint should also include, as attachments, any information or documents relevant to the complaint that are in the bidder’s possession.
The formal complaint is an unsuccessful bidder’s sole opportunity to present their case, and should therefore be drafted accordingly.
Within ten business days of having received a formal complaint, the Chief Procurement Officer will determine whether or not it discloses a reasonable indication that the procurement was not carried out in accordance with the City’s procurement policies and/or the terms of the procurement process. (2014-443)
Unless it will undermine the City’s best interests, final approval and the awarding of the contract shall be postponed pending the outcome of the complaint process. This suspension may be set aside, and final approval for the awarding of a contract may be given, at any time in the complaints process if it is in the City’s best interests to do so.
If the Chief Procurement Officer concludes that the complaint does not disclose credible information to indicate that a breach of the terms of the procurement process or City policies has occurred, no further review of the complaint will take place and the contract shall be awarded in accordance with this By-law.
If the complaint is found to disclose a reasonable indication that the procurement was not carried out in accordance with the City’s policies or the terms of the procurement process, the Chief Procurement Officer will take such necessary action to bring the solicitation back into compliance, which may include the cancellation of the solicitation, or the suspension or cancellation of the bid award. If the issue cannot be resolved appropriately, the Chief Procurement Officer will then refer the matter to a Review Panel, as provided in clause (c), “Phase Three”. (2014-443).
Phase Three: Formal Review:
Where the Chief Procurement Officer has received a complaint that discloses a reasonable indication that the procurement at issue was not carried out in accordance with the City’s procurement policies and/or the terms of the procurement process, it is to be considered by a Review Panel comprised of the Chief Procurement Officer, the City Solicitor (or a designated lawyer from the Legal Services), a representative from the Auditor General’s office and the Fairness Commissioner if applicable. (2021-26)
The Review Panel after considering the complaint will provide a report to the Finance and Corporate Services Committee setting out its recommendation for how the complaint should be dealt with. (2014-443, 2025-33)
The Review Panel report to the Committee will include a description of the procurement process at issue and an overview of the complaint received from the unsuccessful bidder. The panel report will recommend a specific course of action including, where appropriate, an explanation for why that course of action is recommended in response to the complaint.
The report is to be submitted to the Committee within twenty business days from the date upon which the Chief Procurement Officer referred the complaint to the Review Panel.
Phase Four: Role of Finance and Corporate Services Committee (2025-33):
The Finance and Corporate Services Committee is to consider the report at the next regularly scheduled meeting. (2014-443, 2025-33)
The Committee will hear any delegations at the meeting in the standard manner, including the unsuccessful bidder who filed the formal complaint.
The Committee will either endorse the course of action recommended by the Review Panel or adopt an alternative course of action that it considers      appropriate under the circumstances and is consistent with the terms of the solicitation and/or the City’s procurement policies.  The Committee’s decision is final and it will not conduct a second separate review of the complaint.  (2010-291)
Section 47 - Litigation exclusion provision
The City, acting through the Chief Procurement Officer in consultation with the City Solicitor, may in its absolute discretion after considering the criteria outlined in subsection (2), reject a quotation, tender, or proposal submitted by a bidder if the City is engaged in legal action against the bidder, or, if the bidder or any officer or director of the bidder is engaged, either directly or indirectly through a corporation or personally, in a legal action against the City, its elected representatives, appointed officers, or employees,  in relation to:
any other related contract or services; or
any matter arising from the City’s exercise of its powers, duties, or functions. (2014-443, 2017-362, 2021-26)
In determining whether or not to reject a quotation, tender or proposal under this clause, the Chief Procurement Officer and the City Solicitor will consider; (2017-362, 2021-26)
whether the litigation is likely to adversely affect the bidder’s ability to work with the City, its consultants and representatives; or,
whether the City’s experience with the bidder indicates that the City is likely to incur increased staff and legal costs in the administration of the contract if it is awarded to the bidder; or,
whether the bidder has been convicted of a criminal act against the City or one of its local boards or corporations; or,
whether the bidder has failed to satisfy an outstanding debt to the City or one of its local boards or corporations; or,
there are reasonable grounds to believe it would not be in the best interests of the City to enter into a contract with the bidder.
(3) Supply Services is to advise Council by way of a memorandum when the Chief Procurement Officer, in consultation with the City Solicitor, intends to exercise his or her discretion to reject a quotation, tender, or proposal in accordance with subsection (1). (2014-443, 2017-362, 2021-26)
