Section 5
No permit shall be issued for a private approach the purpose of which is to provide access to a parking space

Where an application is made under this by-law and it is determined that an affidavit in support of a claim to non-conforming rights under the applicable Zoning By-law of the old municipality or any successor by-law thereto is required to approve the application, a non-refundable fee for the circulation process of the application described in Schedule “A”, shall be payable to the City, in addition to any other fees payable under this by-law.
Section 7
If the General Manager is satisfied that an application for a private approach complies with the provisions of this by-law, approval shall be granted in writing in the form of a permit by the General Manager.

The General Manager may specify a location and design for a private approach that, in the General Manager's opinion, will eliminate or minimize such hazardous condition.
Despite any other provisions of this by-law, the General Manager may alter the direction of the grade and horizontal distances on which the direction of the grade applies, provided such alterations do not create any drainage issues or hazardous conditions.

Where a median is provided pursuant to paragraph (i), the length of the median on private property shall be determined by the General Manager.

No person shall construct a private approach within an intersection or on the corner radius of an intersection or within 1.5 metres of the point of tangency of such radius or so that the distance between the nearest limit of a private approach and the intersecting street line or its extension is less than 6 metres.
No person shall construct a private approach within 3 metres of any property line measured at the highway line and at the curb or the edge of the roadway unless the property abuts only one public highway and the width of the frontage does not allow a private approach width as required by this by-law in addition to the 3 metres offset from the adjoining property lines in which case the General Manager may reduce the off-set to a minimum of 0.3 metres provided that the proposed access is located,
a safe distance from the access serving the adjacent property,
in such a manner that there are adequate sight lines for vehicles exiting from the property, and
in such a manner that it does not create a traffic hazard.
Subject to paragraph (p), in the case of a private approach including a culvert, the 3 metre setback from the adjacent property line shall be from the end of the culvert, headwall or closest part of the private approach to the adjacent property line.
Despite paragraph (p), a private approach may be constructed in such a manner that it is less than 3 metres from an adjoining property measured at the highway line and at the curb line or edge of the roadway if it is approved through Site Plan Control in accordance with the provision of the Planning Act and the City’s Site Plan Control By-law.

Despite paragraphs (t) and (u), the General Manager may issue a permit for a private approach subject to such conditions and restrictions as the General Manager may deem necessary provided that the proposed access is located;
a safe distance from the access serving the adjacent

where the written consent of the owner of the adjacent property is obtained and filed with the General Manager; or
in the case of a combined approach serving two adjacent properties.
no private approach shall be constructed within an intersection except where the entire property frontage is situated within an intersection or within 3 metres of the limits of an intersection in which case a private approach may be permitted provided that the private approach is not located within the area used or intended to be used as a pedestrian crossing.
the grade on any part of a private approach, excluding the public sidewalk, shall:
not be less than 2%;
not exceed 6%; and
descend in the direction of the roadway.
despite paragraph (g) hereof, the grade of any part of a private approach to a building that is being renovated may be greater than 6% but shall not exceed 12% provided that a subsurface melting device sufficient to keep the private approach free of ice at all times is installed and properly maintained by the owner.
