Introduction
A by-law of the City of Ottawa to provide for the closing of certain classes of retail business establishments for certain hours on Remembrance Day and to repeal By-law No. 2002-421.
In recognition of the significance of Remembrance Day in honouring Canadian Veterans, and those currently serving in the
Canadian Armed Forces
, the City of Ottawa’s Remembrance Day By-law (By-law No. 2008-355), requires most retail businesses to remain closed until 12:30 pm on November 11
th
each year. This by-law deals only with fixed, enclosed premises.
The Council of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:
Highlights
The exceptions to the closure requirements are:
Food/grocery, tobacco, antique and handicraft stores with less than 2,400 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public
Pharmacies with less than 7,500 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public. Therefore, pharmacies located inside larger stores must be closed until 12:30 pm
Book/newspaper dealers which store is less than 2,400 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public
Convenience stores (e.g. “corner” stores)
Nurseries, gardening supply stores and florists
Gasoline/fuel stations and businesses selling propane, diesel, natural gas and associated fuel products
Businesses dealing in the rental of motor vehicles and boats
Businesses dealing in the repair of motor vehicles and boats, which includes the portion of larger stores where vehicle repairs are being provided
Note also that:
The by-law deals only with fixed, enclosed premises
The closure requirement under the by-law does not apply to:
hotels and motels
restaurants (take-out, fast food, sit-down)
recreational facilities and fitness centres
doctors’, dentists’, optometrists’ offices
medical centres
funeral homes
hair salons and spas
pet groomers
vehicle repair shops
repair services for computers, furnaces, air conditioners, pools
pay-day loan services
realtors
dry cleaners
vendors at outdoor markets (i.e. ByWard, Parkdale)
The closure requirement under the by-law
does apply
to:
tourist areas exempted by by-law from the Retail Business Holidays Act (which regulates retail store opening on Statutory Holidays) including the ByWard Market BIA, the Downtown Rideau BIA, the Glebe BIA, the Rideau Centre, Sparks Street Mall and the Loblaws Supermarket at 363 Rideau Street, unless any businesses within those areas fall under an exemption under the Remembrance Day By-law as noted above
in other words, their “tourist area exemption” cannot be used on November 11th. Many of their businesses will have to be closed until 12:30 pm, unless they fall under an exemption in the by-law (e.g. news stand) or the by-law does not apply to them in general (e.g. restaurants)
Street vendors on:
Rideau Street or Wellington Street between Sussex Drive and Metcalfe Street
Elgin Street between Wellington Street and Queen Street
travel agents
eyeglass retailers (i.e. the portion of the space in which eyeglasses are sold)
In the case of car dealerships that also operate repair shops, the retail sales portion of the dealership must be closed to the public. Where the repair portion does not have a separate entrance, clients should be notified that the retail portion is closed (e.g. via signage).
Note that retail businesses which are required to close under the by-law and are normally open 24 hours, are required to be closed from 8:00 am until 12:30 pm on November 11th.
