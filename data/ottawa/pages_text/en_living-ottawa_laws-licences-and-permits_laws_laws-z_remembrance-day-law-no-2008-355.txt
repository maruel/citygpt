A by-law of the City of Ottawa to provide for the closing of certain classes of retail business establishments for certain hours on Remembrance Day and to repeal By-law No. 2002-421.
In recognition of the significance of Remembrance Day in honouring Canadian Veterans, and those currently serving in the
Canadian Armed Forces
, the City of Ottawa’s Remembrance Day By-law (By-law No. 2008-355), requires most retail businesses to remain closed until 12:30 pm on November 11
th
each year. This by-law deals only with fixed, enclosed premises.
The Council of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:
The exceptions to the closure requirements are:
- Food/grocery, tobacco, antique and handicraft stores with less than 2,400 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public
- Pharmacies with less than 7,500 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public. Therefore, pharmacies located inside larger stores must be closed until 12:30 pm
- Book/newspaper dealers which store is less than 2,400 square feet in total area used for serving/selling to the public
- Convenience stores (e.g. “corner” stores)
- Nurseries, gardening supply stores and florists
- Gasoline/fuel stations and businesses selling propane, diesel, natural gas and associated fuel products
- Businesses dealing in the rental of motor vehicles and boats
- Businesses dealing in the repair of motor vehicles and boats, which includes the portion of larger stores where vehicle repairs are being provided

Note also that:
- The by-law deals only with fixed, enclosed premises
- The closure requirement under the by-law does not apply to:
  - hotels and motels
  - restaurants (take-out, fast food, sit-down)
  - recreational facilities and fitness centres

  - medical centres
  - funeral homes
  - hair salons and spas
  - pet groomers
  - vehicle repair shops
  - repair services for computers, furnaces, air conditioners, pools

    - in other words, their “tourist area exemption” cannot be used on November 11th. Many of their businesses will have to be closed until 12:30 pm, unless they fall under an exemption in the by-law (e.g. news stand) or the by-law does not apply to them in general (e.g. restaurants)
  - Street vendors on:
    - Rideau Street or Wellington Street between Sussex Drive and Metcalfe Street
    - Elgin Street between Wellington Street and Queen Street

  - eyeglass retailers (i.e. the portion of the space in which eyeglasses are sold)
- In the case of car dealerships that also operate repair shops, the retail sales portion of the dealership must be closed to the public. Where the repair portion does not have a separate entrance, clients should be notified that the retail portion is closed (e.g. via signage).
