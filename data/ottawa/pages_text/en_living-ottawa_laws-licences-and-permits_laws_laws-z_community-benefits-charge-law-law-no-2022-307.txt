through Bill 23 may impact how the following by-law is applied.
A by-law of the City of Ottawa for the imposition of Community Benefit Charges.
WHEREAS the Council of the City of Ottawa may by by-law, pursuant to Section 37(2) and Section 37.1 of the Planning Act, impose community benefits charges against land to pay for the capital costs of facilities, services and matters required because of development and redevelopment in the area in which the by-law applies;
AND WHEREAS this by-law aims to factor in the provisions of Section 37 by addressing intensification of mid- to high-rise residential development or mixed-used development containing residential units in correlation with growth projections of population and development types outlined in the Official Plan;

AND WHEREAS the Community Benefits Charge may address services listed in Section 2(4) of the Development Charges Act, 1997, provided that the capital costs that are intended to be funded by the community benefits charge are not capital costs that are listed to be funded under a development charge by-law or from the special account referred to in the Planning Act, Subsection 42 (15).;
AND WHEREAS Council approved a community benefits charge strategy pursuant to Section 37(9) of the Planning Act at the Council meeting of August 31, 2022; AND WHEREAS the City consulted with persons and public bodies in the development of the community benefits charge strategy pursuant to Section 37(10) of the Planning Act; Therefore the Council of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:
