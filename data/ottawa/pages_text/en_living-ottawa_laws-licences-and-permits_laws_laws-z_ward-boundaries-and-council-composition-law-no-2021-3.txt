The Tribunal made an
Order
modifying the By-law to include the specific ward boundary modifications approved by Council on April 14, 2021, as referenced in the
April 16, 2021 Ottawa Ward Boundary project update
. The OLT decision will be available on its website in the coming days and available through the above link. The Tribunal further dismissed the balance of the appeals and did not order any other changes to the By-law.
