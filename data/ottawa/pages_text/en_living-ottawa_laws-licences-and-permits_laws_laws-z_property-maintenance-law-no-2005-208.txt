Naturalization Area
In response to a growing interest in the community in having naturalized gardens/yards which, among other benefits, require relatively low maintenance and discourage the use of pesticides, the following information may be of assistance.
Definitions
"
boulevard
" means all parts of a highway save and except the roadway, shoulder or sidewalk;
Naturalized Area:
One that has been deliberately implemented to produce ground cover and includes two or more species of wildflowers, shrubs, perennials, grasses, or combinations of them, whether native or non-native, consistent with a managed and natural landscape, other than regularly mown grass; one where some degree of attention has been placed on native species; one can include a water feature that is deliberately created for the landscape and managed appropriately.
Criteria for naturalized area
A bona fide “naturalized” garden/yard requires that the following criteria be met:
1. Intent
Deliberately implemented to produce ground cover,
The property owner has knowledge of naturalization and its concepts, basis, etc., and can identify most if not all of the plants.
2. Some degree of maintenance/care
The garden/yard is managed to include native species
It is also managed to discourage the presence of exotic invasive species, particularly monocultures
It is managed to prevent encroachment on adjacent properties
The city boulevard is trimmed
3. Presence of native species
Some degree of attention is placed on
native species
, thereby extending natural habitats into the yard
Using this mechanism, a neglected or derelict yard – which consists almost entirely of non-native,
invasive species
– will be more obvious
The added advantage to using native species is that if they are properly matched with the local environment they require no water, no fertilizer and no pesticides which fits well with the goal to reduce chemical inputs and water use in yards.
