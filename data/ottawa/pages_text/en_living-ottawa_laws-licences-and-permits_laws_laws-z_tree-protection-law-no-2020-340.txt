Schedule B – Tree Compensation Requirements
Municipal Trees
For municipally owned trees, City wide, regardless of the reason for removal:
Pay the compensation value of the tree and plant a replacement tree in the Right of Way
The compensation value of the tree is determined by CTLA Trunk Formula method or a replacement ratio, whichever is greater
If a replacement tree cannot be planted then, in addition to the compensation value of the tree, the applicant must pay the cash value of a replacement tree, which is $400
Note that a minimum compensation value of $400 per tree will be charged
For unique scenarios, the valuation method may be determined by the General Manager
Compensation amounts may be adjusted where trees are proposed on a landscape plan
For wooded natural areas, or where there is a substantial number of trees to be removed, a different valuation method may be considered.
Private Trees
For private property in the urban area, 1 hectare or less in size.
Application for removal not associated with a Planning Act application or infill development:
1:1 – Plant a tree for each distinctive tree removed, to be planted on the same private property, implemented by putting it as a condition of the Distinctive Tree permit.
Application for removal associated with infill development:
2:1 or 3:1, based on distinctive tree size for the subject area:
2:1 for each distinctive tree measuring 30-49 cm DBH
3:1 for each distinctive tree measuring 50 cm or greater DBH
Plant the required number of replacement trees for each distinctive tree removed, as required. If all planting cannot be accommodated, must pay the cash value for the number of trees not planted. A replacement tree is valued at $400. For example; if the distinctive tree removed is 54 cm in diameter, 3 replacement trees are required to be planted, if only 1 tree was planted, then the owner owes the City 2 x $400 = $800 for the remaining owed trees.
Trees planted in compensation must be non-invasive species
When planted, the replacement tree must be a minimum of 50 mm measured no less than 15 cm above ground level for deciduous trees, and no less than 200 cm in height as measured from ground level to midway between the tip of the leader and the uppermost whorl, or as otherwise approved by the General Manager.
It is preferable to plant tree species that will attain the largest size at maturity, given the site-specific context.
If the tree cannot be planted on the same private property, it can then be planted on another private property in reasonably close proximity to the removed tree, subject to the property owner’s approval and to the satisfaction of the General Manager.
For private property in the urban area, over 1 hectare in size.
Application for removal not associated with a Planning Act application or infill development:
1:1 – Plant a tree for each protected tree removed, to be planted on the same private property, implemented by putting it as a condition of the tree permit.
For private property in the urban area, of any size, subject to a Planning Act application (Site Plan, Plan of Subdivision):
To be determined through development review process.
For private property in the urban area, of any size, where the tree removed is dead, hazardous, or an ash tree:
1:1 replacement planting
Schedule C - Tree Information Report Guidelines
The objective for these guidelines is to provide clear guidance on the tree information required, based on the type of application, or tree removal situation, when applying for permission to remove a tree. These guidelines will assist consulting arborists, tree care specialists, registered professional foresters, etc., in the preparation of the Tree Information Report for required tree removals, and to confirm the adequate protection of trees to be retained.
The City’s Tree Protection By-law lays out when a Tree Information Report (TIR) or a Tree Conservation Report (TCR) is required. Generally, a TIR is required for the proposed removal of municipal trees city-wide, or of distinctive trees on properties one hectare or less in size within the City’s urban area. A TIR is also required for all Committee of Adjustment applications and Building Permit applications for infill development[1] within the City’s urban area.
The type of application, or the tree removal reason for a given site dictates if a TIR or a TCR is required. Figure 1, on the last page, will help determine which type of report is required.
Table 1 outlines the information required to be included within Tree Information Reports. For all
Planning Act
applications
2
, a Tree Conservation Report is required. Please refer to the TCR Guidelines in Schedule E of the Tree Protection By-law. Following the table, detailed information for each element is described.

“Infill development” means low rise residential development that is not subject to Site Plan Control, Plan of Subdivision, or Plan of Condominium.
2
A
Planning Act
application is a development application under the
Planning Act
for Site Plan Control, Plan of Subdivision, or Plan of Condominium.
3
“No development” includes construction projects not related to infill development. For example, widening a driveway or installing a service, a pool, or a deck, etc.
Tree Information Report Submission
The submission of a Tree Information Report shall occur at the earliest application for any proposed tree removals or works that may impact trees in any way. A TIR is to be submitted as a part of the full application package for infill development. The TIR application form shall be completed, and all other required information must be attached.
The City of Ottawa reserves the right to request further information due to the complexity of the work to be performed and/or deny the application if the submitted Tree Information Report is deemed unsatisfactory by the General Manager. Where the Tree Information Report submission is related to infill development or other construction projects requiring approvals, tree permits will be issued in conjunction with the development approval (eg. building permit, demolition permit, pool enclosure, etc.). However, these other approvals do not in themselves convey permission to remove trees.
For Building Permits for infill development
:
Where there are no trees on the site or neighbouring properties which could be impacted by the proposed work, a statement on the grading plan or site plan that there are no trees on the site must be included.
Exemptions
: Where trees are an immediate threat to public health and safety or qualify for other exemptions listed in Part VI of the Tree Protection By-law, no report is required.
Required information:
For both the TIR-short and TIR-full, complete the Tree Information Report form with the following information:
Contact Information for the Owner, Arborist, and Contractor
:
Please provide name, address, telephone number and email address for the property owner, the arborist, and, if known at the time of application, the contractor.
Tree Information

TIR-Full
– All trees on site must be listed/described, including boundary and adjacent trees with Critical Root Zones extending into the site. The tree locations must be plotted on the grading and site plan, as applicable, by a surveyor or GPS.
Ownership:
The ownership for each tree must be listed within the report (e.g. private, City, boundary
5
, adjacent
6
). If ownership is unknown, a survey may be required. For trees on a shared property line, list the address it is shared with.
5
“
boundary tree
” means a tree, of which any part of the trunk is growing across one or more property lines.
6
“adjacent tree”
means a tree whose trunk is growing on a property sharing a boundary with the subject site.
Condition:
Provide detailed information about the condition of the tree(s). Applications for tree removal based on the condition must provide greater detail on the conditions noted and may require additional documentation such as tree risk assessments (from a reputable source) to support the arborist’s recommendation. The determination of the condition will be based on some of the following factors, and should also consider the level of risk associated with the condition and whether any mitigation options are available:
Structural Integrity (Have there been recent limb failures? List evidence of structural weaknesses, noticeable stress cracks, frost cracks, weak unions, and included bark unions)
Deadwood (%)
Vigour (Is the tree healthy and in leaf, or in decline and struggling?)
Are there any insects infesting? (list type and extent of infestation)
Are there any pathological concerns? (list type and extent of infection)
Are fungal fruiting bodies evident? (list type and extent of decay)
Is decay evident at unions, base, or elsewhere? A bore test, ultrasound or resistograph may be required to determine extent of decay.
Is the tree causing damage to structures? List type and location of damage. May require additional reports and/or proof of remedial work completed. Requests to remove a City tree for this reason must follow the 4-phase assessment process for
trees and foundation damage
.
Does the tree have a significant lean? Are there signs of potential uprooting with a pull test?
Or other factors deemed acceptable by the General Manager
Client’s Reason for Removal:
Provide client’s reason for requesting tree removal. Examples could include, but are not limited to:
For construction purposes, eg., new house, addition, landscaping, etc.
Safety (Is the tree hazardous? If yes, identify the concern)
Damage to a structure or private property (an engineer’s report may be required).
The tree is in decline and is no longer viable to maintain.
Arborist’s Recommendation
:
Provide arborist’s recommendation for the tree(s), as well as any protection and/or mitigation measures to be implemented for retained trees.
TIR – Short
– The arborist must provide recommendation for the course of action for the tree(s).
TIR-Full
– The arborist must identify and recommend which tree(s) will be removed and which will be retained/protected, based on their assessment of the work proposed on site and the distance between the tree(s) and excavation. Recommendations should also include changes to the proposed work that would allow for tree retention. For retained/protected trees, mitigation measures must be illustrated and noted on the grading plan and site plan, as appropriate.
For trees that are to be retained and protected, the tree protection measures outlined in Part VI of the Tree Protection By-law must be implemented. Please also refer to the City’s
Tree Protection Specification
. If the full CRZ cannot be protected, mitigation measures must be described in the report, shown on the plan and implemented accordingly.
Photographs
:
Provide photographs of each tree to be removed, showing the condition of the tree and reason for removal, as applicable.
Plans:
TIR-Short
– A plan may be required depending on the level of complexity of the work to be performed.
TIR-Full
– Tree removal and tree protection information must include:
A plan showing the locations of all trees (including boundary and adjacent trees) and their critical root zones
7
.
The location of tree protection fencing.
All proposed excavation limits
8
(including for buildings, projections, services, retaining walls, driveways, etc.).
Measurements from the nearest edge of the trunk to adjacent excavation limits.
All trees protected under the City’s Tree Protection By-law must be shown on the map. The map must use symbols or colours to differentiate between private trees and municipal trees, and whether the trees are proposed for retention or removal. Retained trees require protection measures to be shown and details on required mitigation practices also.
All this information must be overlaid on the grading plan and site plan, and the plan must be updated with any changes made through the associated review process. Full TIRs without plans will not be accepted.
7
The critical root zone (CRZ) is established as being 10 centimetres from the trunk of a tree for every 10 centimetre of trunk DBH measured in a radius around the tree. The CRZ is calculated as DBH x 10 cm.
8
“excavation limits” means the full extent of excavation for the proposed work, including any required sloping or shoring.
Tree Retention and Protection (TIR-Full):
Where trees are to be retained and protected, tree protection measures must be provided in the report and illustrated on the plan (accounting for physical constraints), mitigation strategies to be implemented prior to construction and maintained for the full duration of construction. Please refer Part VI of the City of Ottawa’s Tree Protection By-law for the required tree protection measures.
Boundary tree confirmation (TIR-Full):
Where trees that are jointly owned are impacted, consent from the other property owner must be obtained. The signature of the other property owner must be included on the application form to confirm consent. Where an agreement cannot be reached, adjustments to the proposed plan may be required. A Tree Removal Permit will not be issued without each owner’s consent.
Tree Replacement Information (TIR-Full):
Any replacement planting must take place after the completion of work to be done or following construction project completion. For each replacement tree, provide:
tree size
species
quantity
location on property (shown on the site plan or on a landscape plan
9
)
9
Proposed planting locations may be shown on the site plan or separated into a Landscape Plan. Any separate Landscape Plan submitted must show any retained trees in addition to trees proposed to be planted.
The planting of large shade trees using a variety of species is encouraged to fulfill the objective of a diverse, sustainable urban forest.
Please refer to Schedule B of the City’s Tree Protection By-law for tree compensation requirements.
When planted, the replacement tree must be a minimum of 50 mm measured no less than 15 cm above ground level for deciduous trees, and no less than 200 cm in height as measured from ground level to midway between the tip of the leader and the uppermost whorl, or as otherwise approved by the General Manager.
Additional information:
Depending on the complexity of the work to be performed, other reports may be required. For example, a Tree Risk Assessment from a viable source (ISA, Arboriculture Canada, etc.) could be necessary to justify a tree removal, a Landscape Plan should be included to show any replacement/new planting, and a Butternut Health Assessment could be required if Butternut trees are on site.
Federal and Provincial Regulations:
The arborist is responsible to abide by all Federal and Provincial Regulations such as the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, etc. when evaluating and recommending best course of action for any site. If any Federal and Provincial Regulations apply to the specific site application, related permits or mitigation needs must be noted.
Self-Declaration Statement:
For both TIR-short and TIR-full, the application form must be signed by the property owner, arborist and contractor (if known at time of application), which confirms that all parties agree with the information provided and will respect the proposed work and mitigation measures. By signing the application, you are also acknowledging and understanding that an inspector may enter the property at a reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out an inspection. You also acknowledge and understand that through failure to abide by the recommendations of the approved Tree Information Report, damaging or destructing trees identified for protection, you will be responsible to bear fully the cost of compensation, removal, and replacement.
It is the owner/applicant’s responsibility to ensure that all protection and mitigation measures described in the TIR are followed, and where necessary are done so under the supervision of an arborist.

Schedule E - Tree Conservation Report Guidelines
Introduction
The importance of protecting vegetation cover on sites subject to development is outlined in the Official Plan (Section 4.7.2). The Tree Conservation Report (TCR) provides essential information that must be integrated with all plans for a site, including the grading, servicing and landscape plans, to ensure that trees are retained in development scenarios, where feasible, and that new trees will be accommodated and planted to contribute to the City’s forest cover target and to address a site’s tree loss.
The purpose of the Tree Conservation Report is to demonstrate how tree cover will be retained on the site, including mature trees, stands of trees, and hedgerows, using a design with nature approach to planning and engineering. A design with nature approach incorporates the natural features of a site into the design and engineering of a proposed development. This includes, but is not limited to, measures such as retention of vegetation, consideration of wildlife habitats, and respect for natural drainage patterns.
The report will consider natural features not only on the study site, but on the surrounding landscape as well. This will provide context for the site and show natural area representation surrounding the given site.
The report will identify and describe the vegetative cover on the site prior to development. It will provide a professional opinion on the priority of treed areas to be conserved. It will show how the priority features have been incorporated into the proposed development and how they will be adequately protected for the long-term.
The Tree Conservation Report Guidelines are meant to be applied in coordination with other City of Ottawa guidelines including the ‘Significant Woodlands Guidelines for Identification, Evaluation and Impact Assessment’ and the ‘Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines’.
Process
The Tree Conservation Report is required for all Plans of Subdivision, Site Plan Control Applications, Common Elements Condominium Applications, and Vacant Land Condominium Applications where there is a tree
10
of 10 centimetres in diameter or greater on the site and/or if there is a tree on an adjacent site that has a Critical Root Zone (CRZ)
11
extending onto the development site.
The report will be prepared by an individual with proven expertise and/or professional qualifications in forestry, ecology, biology, arboriculture, or landscape architecture in accordance with the definition of “arborist” in Section 1 of the Tree Protection By-law.
The TCR must be submitted prior to any activities occurring on-site that might impact the trees. It may be submitted at the time of pre-consultation, prior to an application being made, or with the application. In some cases, a preliminary Tree Conservation Report may be required to support on-site investigations (e.g., boreholes).
Amendments to the TCR shall be submitted for approval if changes are required as a result of investigative site works, infrastructure and engineering approvals, or other plan changes. Tree removal, and any activities that could injure trees, must not occur until the amendment has been approved.
At the discretion of the General Manager, the TCR may be combined with the Landscape Plan or the Environmental Impact Statement.
The removal of trees on the site cannot occur until written approval of the Tree Conservation Report has been granted through a tree permit (as per the Tree Protection By-law). The approval of the TCR will come in the form of a letter (the tree permit) from the General Manager, or designate, with conditions specific to the site, tree retention and associated tree protection, and tree removal.
The approved TCR is a requirement for the approval of the development applications listed above.
A copy of the report must be available on-site during tree removal, grading, construction, or any other site alteration activities, and for the duration of construction on the site.
The grading, servicing, and landscape plans as well as all other approved plans will be consistent with and follow the recommendations made and approved in the Tree Conservation Report.
Elements outlined in the Tree Conservation Report will be incorporated into conditions of draft plan approval and shown on the other approved plans (i.e., Landscape Plan, Grading Plan and/or Site Plan) where relevant.
The General Manager reserves the right to refuse or reject a submission and to ask for additional information by other qualified persons.
The General Manager may require that the report be prepared and stamped by a Registered Professional Forester (RPF).
10
“Tree” is defined as any species of woody perennial plant, including its root system, which has reached or can reach a minimum height of at least 450 cm at physiological maturity.
11
The critical root zone (CRZ) is established as being 10 centimetres from the trunk of a tree for every centimetre of trunk DBH measured in a radius around the tree. The CRZ is calculated as DBH x 10 cm.
Elements
The Tree Conservation Report will include the following elements:
An inventory of the trees currently on site, including species composition (where applicable), diameter at breast height, age, and condition and health of the trees.
Where appropriate, groups of trees may be combined into stands for inventory purposes. Stand information must include; percent species composition, average diameter at breast height, general health, and a general stand description.
When present, the following natural elements must be identified:
Surface water features, including vernal pools, wetlands and watercourses;
Steep slopes, including valleys and escarpments;
Valued woodlots designated as Urban Natural Features or Natural Environment Areas, areas evaluated in the Urban Natural Areas Environmental Evaluation Study (UNAEES), or other areas that meet the criteria used in the UNAEES;
Significant woodlands;
High quality, specimen trees;
Hazardous trees;
The presence of riparian woodlots, rare communities or other unique ecological features; and
Species at Risk and their habitat.
Map #1 Current Vegetation - A current aerial photograph of the site (available through the City’s geoOttawa tool) showing the current vegetation mapped as an overlay. This map must be at the same scale as the draft plan of subdivision or site plan. The following elements must be included:
The property line;
The vegetation communities;
Single trees and small clumps of trees;
Trees on adjacent sites with a CRZ extending onto the development site;
Ownership of all trees – City, private, shared ownership (boundary trees), as well as trees on adjacent sites if they have a CRZ extending onto the development area.
Existing buildings and impervious surfaces (e.g. driveways and parking lots);
Locations of any natural elements listed under 3 above and/or other important features identified in EIS and other environmental studies;
Names of surrounding roads; and
Standard mapping elements such as a north arrow, scale, date, and legend.
Map #2 Proposed Development and Conserved Vegetation – The same aerial photograph of the site as in Map #1 showing the proposed development or the proposed plan of undertaking
12
as an overlay. This must be at the same scale as the draft plan of subdivision or site plan. The following elements must be included:
Proposed development (including; roads, infrastructure, stormwater management, lot lines, etc. and the limits of the construction area) or the proposed plan of undertaking;
The property line;
Any relevant setback lines, for example for; watercourses, zoning, geotechnical, or anything identified in an EIS for an environmental feature.
Existing buildings and impervious surfaces (e.g. driveways and parking lots);
Treed areas identified for protection and the associated tree protection measures;
Trees and/or treed areas identified for removal;
Identified natural elements and/or other important features as per Map#1;
Names of surrounding roads; and
Standard mapping elements such as a north arrow, scale, date, and legend.
Identify the vegetation that will be retained and why it has been chosen for retention. If there are several vegetated areas on site or a large area, it should be identified how the areas are prioritized for retention.
An indication of how park and school locations, road locations, infrastructure, stormwater management facilities, creative lot layouts, and design approaches can help to conserve vegetated areas, where feasible.
The impact of the development on the conserved portions of vegetation should be examined and outlined, including and not limited to the impacts of grade change, changes to drainage patterns, effects of impervious surfaces and new buildings, and changes in the water table.
Describe mitigation measures that will be used to promote the long-term survival of retained trees and woodlands (e.g. buffers for protection, fencing, single loaded roads along forest stands, edge preparation, or any other measures as required given the site conditions).
Describe the protection measures required to prevent impacts to retained trees and woodlands during construction. Include protection measures for any trees on adjacent property that may be impacted by the construction. The tree protection measures must be consistent with the City of Ottawa’s Tree Protection Specification in Part VI of the Tree Protection By-law or as approved by the General Manager or designate.
Where there is substantial alteration of the tree cover on the site, consider the impact on fauna or rare species during and after construction and propose mitigation measures, using the City’s Protocol for Wildlife Protection during Construction. Indicate how this adheres to existing legislation on species protection.
Include tree planting recommendations for the site which will help offset the vegetation loss on the site and will also be used to direct the development of the Landscape Plan, including the following:
The species to be used for the given site conditions;
The use of native, non-invasive tree species. In applicable areas, the most current Guidelines for Tree Planting in Sensitive Marine Clay Soils must be followed; and
Where tree planting is required to provide protection for watercourses and steep slopes.
