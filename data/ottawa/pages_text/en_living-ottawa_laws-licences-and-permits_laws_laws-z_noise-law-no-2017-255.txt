Section 25 – Ambient sound level measurement
When a standard sound equivalent level (dB(A)) test cannot be used because ambient noise exceeds the maximum noise limit established for the device, vehicle or equipment to be measured, a differential reading may be used to isolate the level of noise contributed by the device, vehicle or equipment in question as follows:
a noise level reading shall be taken when the device, vehicle or equipment is not in operation;
a noise level reading shall be taken when the device, vehicle or equipment is in operation; and
where the noise level reading calculated in paragraph (b) exceeds the noise level reading calculated in paragraph (a) by 5 dB(A) or more, a noise violation exists.
No person shall use or operate or cause to be used or operated any device, vehicle or equipment, the noise from which has a level greater than 5 dB(A) above ambient noise levels, provided that the ambient noise levels are greater than the specified maximum level for the device, vehicle or equipment in question.
