Schedule A
The Amended Montreal Road CIP will provide a financial incentive in the form of a Tax Increment Equivalent Grant (TIEG) to property owners with eligible development and redevelopment projects within the Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan Project Area. The grant will be equivalent to a portion of the increase in the municipal property taxes directly attributable to the improvement. TIEG grants will be funded through the incremental municipal property tax increase associated with the improvement.
The program assumes that development would not occur 'but for' the incentive made to the property owner. Grants will be paid only after site development is completed, the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) has reassessed the property and the first year of taxes at the new assessment have been paid in full.
The program will commence on or after the date that this Plan comes into effect. Staff will conduct a detailed review of the Amended Montreal Road CIP program every four years, reporting back to Committee and Council within the 6-month period following each municipal election. This review will include an analysis of program ROI including a reconciliation of current and anticipated CIP grant funding commitments. Staff will report on program effectiveness, whether the program should be continued or cancelled and if continued, provide recommendations whether eligibility criteria, incentive structure, administration, performance measures and reporting should be modified to position the program to better realize program intent.
1. Development Incentive Grant Program
The intent of the Development Incentive Grant Program is to encourage the rehabilitation of lands and buildings and/or stimulate new development on sites previously occupied. The Development Incentive Grant Program will also encourage infill and mixed-use development, and assist in achieving improved building architecture, site design and site landscaping in the area. These benefits Will be encouraged by offering a financial incentive in the form of an annual grant.
All submissions under the Amended Montreal Road CIP program must be for redevelopment (not greenfield development) of properties located within the defined boundaries of the Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan Project Area as described in By-law 2019-213.
Eligible projects can include non-residential properties and/or mixed-use properties that include one or more residential dwelling units. Ground floor space in eligible mixed-use properties, however, must be exclusively comprised of active uses except those properties having ground floor tenant space with frontage on Montreal Road that are required to have active uses in the front 6 metres as a minimum under the Zoning By-law, but permit ground floor dwelling units farther than 6 metres back from the frontage.
Active uses shall promote a lively pedestrian environment on the ground floor and may include, but not be limited to shops, small businesses, markets, cafes, arts workshops, retail establishments, restaurants, catering establishments, bars and brewpubs, art and craft studios, performance space, wineries, and personal service establishments.
Candidate properties will be reviewed in detail, based on best knowledge of current trends and history to ensure that an incentive is, in fact, required to stimulate development. The applicant is required to provide a rationale clearly demonstrating that the project would not otherwise proceed in the absence of the incentive and that the project meets a need in the community for urban renewal and/or job creation appropriate to the local labour market or goods/services provision to the local consumer or business market.
The City will reimburse the successful applicants in the form of an annual grant equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the municipal tax increment resulting from the redevelopment. Grants will extend for up to 1O years after project completion to a maximum of five million dollars ($5,000,000), but not exceeding fifty per cent (50%) of the total cost of the redevelopment project.
2. Quartier Vanier District
The Montreal Road CIP Project Area extends along Montreal Road from North River Road in the west, to the Aviation Parkway in the east. However, a distinctive change in character exists between the "arterial commercial" context east of St. Laurent Boulevard, compared with the ''main street/storefront commercial" context in the western section between North River Road and St. Laurent Boulevard. This western segment, which coincides with the boundary of the Montreal Road portion of the Vanier BIA, is unique. Not only does it exhibit a broad diversity of land uses, limited vacancy, and a notable presence of independent businesses, but it also has become a hub for artists, artistic and cultural organizations, social enterprises, not-for-profit organizations, and entrepreneurs, making it one of the most distinct and dynamic communities in Ottawa.
Building on existing strengths and diversity in this unique area, two special programs are available for redevelopment projects that qualify under the Development Incentive Grant Program. These additional incentives will be available to successful applicants under the Montreal Road CIP Development Incentive Grant Program where the project includes one or more of the specific elements detailed below, that will strengthen and enhance the distinctive nature of the Quartier Vanier District.
2.1. Support for Cultural Activities and Artists Supplementary Benefit
Building on existing strengths and diversity in the Quartier Vanier District, the "Support for Cultural Activities and Artists Supplementary Benefit" will support the life and work of artists in Vanier, helping to enhance the heritage, cultural and creative sector in the area.
The objective of the program is to support the area's artists and arts organizations and encourage collaboration between artists and property owners, to provide access to affordable space for cultural activities, arts, and arts programming, and create new opportunities for arts activities.
Eligibility for the Support for Cultural Activities and Artists Supplementary Benefit is defined as projects that provide a minimum of three hundred square meters (300 M
2
) of space dedicated to arts and cultural activities.
To maintain the supplementary benefit, dedicated arts/cultural space must be designed and used exclusively and continuously throughout the grant period for arts and cultural endeavours including one or more of the following:
creation, practice, sale, development and or public presentation of artistic, cultural, heritage and/or Indigenous activities; and/or
administration of an artistic, cultural, heritage and/or Indigenous for profit or not-for-profit organization whose mandate is to present artistic, cultural, heritage and/or Indigenous activities to the public of Ottawa or elsewhere.
2.2 Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit
As with 2,1 above, the "Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit" is intended to build on existing strengths and diversity in the Quartier Vanier District.
A social enterprise is defined under the Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit program as a not-for-profit organization with primarily social objectives and an overall mission to serve the public good. These organizations may sell goods, provide services, or operate one or more not-for­ profit enterprises to generate earned income to create a blended financial and social return on investment. Their profits are returned to the business or to a social purpose, rather than maximizing profits to shareholders. Social enterprise organizations reinvest their earned income into realizing their social mission and pursuing the development of the community rather than being driven by the need to maximize profit for shareholders and owners.
Where eligibility under one or more of: Support for Cultural Activities and Artists Supplementary Benefit or Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit programs has been met, the City will reimburse the owner in the form of an annual grant equal to seventy-five per cent (75%) of the municipal tax increment for the property. Grants will extend up to a 10-year period after project completion to a maximum of five million dollars ($5,000,000), but not exceeding fifty per cent (50%) of the total cost of the redevelopment project.
Grants will be paid only after site development is completed, the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) has reassessed the property and the first year of taxes at the new assessment have been paid in full.
3. Approvals
Applications will be processed and approved on a first come, first served basis, subject to availability of funding as approved by Council.
Staff from Economic Development and Long-Range Planning and Financial Services will examine each application. This review will ensure that the projects receiving grants are eligible under the program and that they do not represent 'organic growth', but rather are occurring because of financial incentives. In the case of applications under the Support for Cultural Activities Incentive Grant Program and Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit program, this review shall include staff from Cultural Services.
Staff will prepare a report for each application under the Amended Montreal Road CIP and submit it to Council for approval.
As a condition of approval of an application for an Amended Montreal Road CIP grant, the applicant must enter into an agreement with the City. The agreement will be registered against the land to which it applies and will specify the terms, duration, and default provisions of the grant.
Following approval by Council, each year until the end of the grant period, or until the maximum grant amount has been reached, staff will:
review the project to ensure that performance targets and qualifying requirements continue to be met;
confirm that the owner has paid the property taxes in full for that year; and
confirm that all other amounts to be paid to the City are in good standing.
4. Program duration and limits
The Ontario Planning Act sets no legal time limit for completing a Community Improvement Plan. Accordingly, in order to allow time for full assessment, design, and planning, and to provide time for City outreach and marketing, the grant program is open-ended with no expiry date but subject to review by Council within 6 months following each Term of Council.
In the case of Council-approved TIEG grants that have been approved for a duration of up to ten years, discontinuation of the program or a change in grant entitlement will not affect or reduce the approved grant amounts, or the grant entitlement period.
All grants are offered subject to Council approval of operating funds where applicable. The commencement of timing for program duration for each incentive grant starts on the date the application is approved by Council.
5. Goals and objectives
The principal goals of the Amended Montreal Road CIP are to attract new business investment to the area and to encourage rehabilitation, redevelopment, and revitalization of the existing built environment. This will provide enhanced employment opportunities and commercial vibrancy while supporting the activities of arts and heritage organizations, all of which are important for the health and liveability of Montreal Road.
Other goals include:
Improve the appearance of the Montreal Road streetscape and buildings, including built cultural heritage resources and façade improvements through redevelopment;
Encourage a range of higher density housing types, including affordable housing, in the area to help offset affordability losses attributable to increased property values, and reinforce the Montreal Road area as a hub for the artistic and cultural community;
Build on existing strengths and diversity in the area by supporting the life and work of artists in Vanier and help to revitalize the heritage, cultural and creative sector in the area;
Increase employment opportunities;
Encourage redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties;
Improve physical and visual quality of the commercial center along Montreal Road;
Improve environmental health and safety (including energy efficiency);
Stimulate private investment activity and private property maintenance;
Reinforce the Montreal Road area as an important commercial and employment center within Rideau-Vanier Ward; and
Strengthen the area as a recognized "live, work, create and play" destination.
6. Community Improvement Plan Project Area
The Montreal Road CIP Project Area is as defined in City of Ottawa By-law 2019- 213 which designates a part of the area covered by the Official Plan for the City of Ottawa as the Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan Project Area.
The incentive program will be available for eligible properties within the Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan Project Area. All owners of private properties in the Montreal Road CIP Project Area may apply for a CIP grant. The CIP will not apply to public road rights-of-way, residential properties, or greenfield development.
In cases where the CIP Project Area boundary does not follow a property line, only that portion of the property and building(s) within the CIP Project Area will qualify for the Amended Montreal Road CIP program. City staff will determine the limit of the project area on properties where a lot line is not followed at the time an application is submitted.
7. Community Improvement Plan Incentive Program
Among several incentive options available for Ontario municipalities under the provisions of the
Ontario Planning Act
, the Amended Montreal Road CIP will include only a Tax Increment Equivalent Grant (TIEG) grant. The TIEG program will be structured to cover costs associated with the progression of typical redevelopment projects from inception to completion. All grants will be paid only after the site development is completed, the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) has reassessed the property, and the first year of taxes at the new rate have been paid in full.
Grants will be funded from incremental property tax assessments and the corresponding increased contribution to tax revenues made by owners of CIP project properties that, but for the provision of financial incentives, would not otherwise have occurred.
As the municipality receives the additional property taxes that result from the increased assessment associated with the redevelopment, the City will reimburse the owner in the form of an annual grant. Grants will extend up to 10 years after project completion to a maximum of five million dollars ($5,000,000), but not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the total eligible costs for the redevelopment project.
The assessment and municipal property taxes ("base rate") will be determined before commencement of the project. The increase in municipal property taxes (or ''municipal tax increment") is calculated by subtracting the municipal property taxes before reassessment from the municipal property taxes after reassessment as determined by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) following project completion. The amount of the grant payment will be recalculated annually based on the municipal property taxes levied and the resultant municipal tax increment paid by the owner for that year.
To be eligible for payment of an Amended Montreal Road CIP grant, the amount of work undertaken on the property and/or buildings must result in a minimum increase of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in the assessed value of the property as determined through post-construction reassessment by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC).
While the City cannot guarantee that the benefits of the Amended Montreal Road CIP program will flow through to tenants, the property owner is required to inform the tenant(s) of their participation in the Amended Montreal Road CIP program. There is no requirement for the property owner and tenant to submit an application jointly. The owner must provide evidence to the City that the tenant is aware of the program so that they may negotiate lease terms with complete information.
Amended Montreal Road CIP incentives will only be available to the owner that signed the original grant application and incentives are not transferable. If all or part of a property is sold within a grant eligibility period, then grant payments will be discontinued immediately.
However, the City may, at its discretion, transfer all or part of a grant amount to a new property owner subject to the new owner entering into an agreement (where applicable) with the City that fulfills the requirements of the original agreement, plus any new requirements.
Coordinated development proposals that include abutting properties under the same or separate ownership will be subject to a maximum grant amount, which may not exceed the lesser of five million dollars ($5,000,000) or fifty per cent (50%) of eligible costs for the project and are treated as if the development consisted of a single property. (i.e., more than one application for the same type of grant on abutting properties that comprise a coordinated development is not permitted).
The Amended Montreal Road CIP may be combined with any other CIP program, including the Brownfields Redevelopment Program, Affordable Housing CIP, and Heritage CIP to encourage the creation of new affordable housing units. The total aggregate grant will still not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) or fifty per cent (50%) of eligible costs for the project.
The commencement of timing for program duration for each incentive grant starts on the date the application is approved by Council, as required based on total program funding amount.
The financial incentive programs in this GIP will apply to the private sector and are designed to encourage private sector investment and revitalization of properties within the Montreal Road ClP Project Area.

All submissions under the Amended Montreal Road CIP must be in reference to properties located within the defined boundaries of the Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan Project Area illustrated in By­ law no. 2019-213.
10.2. Property type and residential uses
Where zoning permits, mixed-use developments with ground floor commercial will be required to be a minimum of four (4) storeys.
Eligible projects can include non-residential properties and/or mixed-use properties that include one or more residential dwelling units. However, ground floor space in eligible mixed-use properties must be exclusively comprised of active uses. The front six metres of properties with ground floor tenant space with frontage on Montreal Road, where permitted under the Zoning By-law must be exclusively comprised of active uses.
Active uses shall promote an active pedestrian environment on the ground floor and may include, but not be limited to shops, small businesses, markets, cafes, arts workshops, retail establishments, restaurants, catering establishments, bars and brewpubs, art and craft studios, performance space, wineries, and personal services.
10.3. Ineligible uses
Commercial uses that do not contribute to a desirable community fabric will not be eligible for an incentive under the Amended Montreal Road CIP program.
Uses not eligible for CIP incentives include: videogame arcades, bingo parlours and other gaming facilities, adult novelty stores and/or adult entertainment, industrial uses, which, by their nature, generate noise, fumes, odours, and are hazardous or obnoxious, body rub establishments, correctional facilities, and corrections residences, payday loan establishments, emergency shelters, pawnshops, and cash-for-goods places, or short-term loan offices.
In addition, auto-oriented uses or development forms that depend on motor vehicle access for their primary function (automobile service stations, gas stations, body shops, automobile rental establishments, auto wreckers, automobile dealerships or showrooms, drive-through facilities, surface parking lots, warehousing, and storage facilities etc.) will not be eligible for GIP incentives.
11. Administration
Economic Development and Long-Range Planning (EDLRP) will manage and administer the Montreal Road CIP program with participation from the Development Review Services Branch (DRS), Cultural Services, and Financial Services.
Final approval of all new GIP grants will be contingent on Council approving the first year of grant payment at the time of the annual City budget approval. Once a grant application is approved and an agreement is entered into between the City and the applicant, the City is obliged to continue annual grant payments as set out in the agreement. However, the recipient's accounts with the City - taxes, water, any fines, etc. - must be in good standing, and on an annual basis, the current year's property taxes have been paid before the grant is released.
Prospective applicants may have an initial conversation regarding the Amended Montreal Road CIP program with either an Economic Development Officer from EDLRP or with a representative of DRS. In either case, these initial conversations may lead to a property owner proceeding with a formal CIP program application.
Where the property owner does wish to proceed, and when initial discussions suggest the likelihood of acceptance under the Amended Montreal Road CIP program, the next step will be a required preliminary pre-consultation meeting to be arranged by EDLRP.
Projects must demonstrate through the CIP application pre-consultation process with DRS, consistency with the policy context applicable to the development location with respect to density, built form, proposed uses and site design in keeping with the intent of Sections 3 and 5 of the Official Plan, or any applicable Secondary Plan, Community Design Plan, or Area-Specific Policy.
Where a Site Plan application is required, both EDLRP and DRS will be required at this meeting. At the pre-consultation meeting, the applicant will be advised about any additional steps that may be required. For example, the applicant may be advised that the project may require a Site Plan, Rezoning, Transportation Study, Conservation or Heritage Authority input, etc.
For those cases where the project may proceed directly to Building Permit, the EDLRP representative will arrange a subsequent meeting with a Development Information Officer (DI0) and Building Services. The applicant will be advised about any additional steps that may be required. For example, the applicant may be advised that their project will require separate permit applications for signs, encroachment, etc.
Where these initial conversations confirm that the project should proceed, subject to required approvals that form part of the process, the applicant will then complete an Amended Montreal Road CIP Program Application. The application must include required supporting documentation, including an independent tax study that sets out an estimate of the anticipated property assessment increment prepared by a qualified consultant, having an AACI designation (Accredited Appraiser Canadian Institute), and must be submitted to the CIP Coordinator in Economic Development Services.
EDLRP staff, together with DRS and Finance Services will review the application, perform such due diligence as is deemed appropriate and forward the application, together with any analysis or additional information, to Committee and Council.
In the case of applications under the Support for Cultural Activities Incentive Grant Program and/or Support for Social Enterprises Supplementary Benefit program, this review shall also include staff from Cultural Services.
Where an Amended Montreal Road CIP incentive has been approved for a project, EDLRP will inform the applicant and immediately begin a process to initiate a formal agreement, which will be prepared by the City's Legal Department, based on the detailed information supplied by the applicant in the CIP grant application. Each year until the end of the grant period or until the maximum grant amount has been reached, staff will review the project to ensure that the owner has paid the property taxes in full for that year and all other amounts to be paid to the City are in good standing.
Concurrent with this process to enter into a formal CIP incentive agreement, the applicant will conclude any remaining design requirements and proceed with next steps required in the process of development and permit approvals.
These additional steps may include one or more of the following permits and approvals, but are not restricted to the following:
1. Site Plan Approval
2. Permits
a) Demolition permit
b) Application for construction permit
c) Septic permit
d) Zoning and Permitted Uses
e) Compliance
f) Official Plan Amendment
g) Minor variance etc.
3. Other approvals
a) Lot grading approval
b) Ministry of Natural Resources consent
c) Permit required from Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO)
d) Permission to fill (Conservation Authority)
e) Monitoring and Amendments
f) Etc.
The City will conduct periodic reviews of the activities relating to community improvement under this CIP to determine effectiveness. Council may utilize this information to further amend the Amended Montreal Road Community Improvement Plan as necessary to ensure that program objectives are achieved.
The feedback from monitoring the CIP may lead to minor program revisions. Therefore, the City may periodically review and adjust the terms and requirements of any of the programs contained in this CIP or discontinue any of the programs, without amendment to the CIP. Such minor changes or discontinuation of programs will be provided to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing for information purposes. Increases in funding provided by existing financial incentives or changes to eligibility criteria that will increase funding provided, the addition of any new programs to this
CIP, or an expansion of the CIP Project Area will require a formal amendment to the CIP in accordance with Section 28 of the
Planning Act
.
12. Financing
Operating pressures associated with approved Amended Montreal Road CIP grants will be brought forward through the budget process in the anticipated year(s) of payout and funded through the incremental taxes that will be generated from the community improvements.
