Schedule A - Display of civic numbers
The civic number shall, at a minimum, be on the main building on the property in proximity to the principal entrance to the building. Where required based on the minimum setbacks indicated in Table 1 or if the view of the civic number on the building is obstructed, the civic number shall also be displayed on a blade sign or ground sign adjacent to the main entrance to the property.
A civic number sign shall be in accordance with the following table:
Table 1
Column I
Column II
Minimum Setback from Property Line*
Minimum Character Height
≤ 3 m
10.0 cm
> 3 m but ≤ 9 m
12.5 cm
> 9 m but ≤ 18 m
15.0 cm
Over 18 m
Civic number on building plus blade sign or, where permitted, ground sign
* Distance is calculated from the location on the building where the civic number is to be displayed to the property line adjacent to the private road or highway to which the building is addressed. In the case of buildings adjacent to a private road where the property on which multiple buildings are situated is a single lot, and where measurement of the setback from the property line is not feasible, the measurement is from the centre line of the private road and 5 m should be added to the figures in Column I.
A civic number posted on a building must:
be in a numerical format (cursive or roman numerals are not acceptable);
have a height-to-width ratio of 5:3;
be displayed right side up;
be of solid, contrasting colours for the character and background, e.g. black on white;
be visible at all times from the private road or highway in either direction and clear of obstructions. If a civic number is posted on a door, it must be posted on the outermost door (e.g. on the outside of the screen or storm door and not on the main door where it may be obscured from view by the screen or storm door); and
have a height above grade between 2 and 4 m.
The following requirements apply for a civic number posted on a blade sign:
the City shall supply and install the initial permanent blade sign, hardware and post for the fee detailed in Schedule C;
a replacement permanent blade sign and post, or a replacement permanent blade sign, must be obtained from the City;
a replacement permanent blade sign and post, or a replacement permanent blade sign, may be installed by the Owner or by the City at the Owner’s expense for the fee detailed in Schedule C;
a blade sign shall be located at the private road or highway adjacent to the principal vehicular entrance and setback no more than 1.5 m from the interior of the property line. For corner lots, the sign must be located adjacent to the vehicular or pedestrian access that fronts on the private road or highway to which the civic address relates;
a blade sign shall be mounted perpendicular to the private road or highway and clear of all obstructions so that it is visible when approaching from either direction;
a blade sign shall be located at a minimum height above grade of 1.2 m;
if the support structure obstructs visibility of one side of the sign, one blade sign per side on the structure is required;
permanent blade sign posts shall be installed a minimum of 0.9 m in the ground; and
in addition to meeting the requirements in d. through f., a temporary blade sign and post must be of durable material, installed and sufficiently stabilized to retain its vertical orientation, and the civic number displayed on the sign must be visible from the private road or highway when approaching from either direction.
The following requirements apply for a civic number displayed on a ground sign:
a ground sign displaying a civic number shall be located at the private road or highway adjacent to the principal vehicular entrance. For corner lots, the sign must be located adjacent to the vehicular or pedestrian access that fronts on the private road or highway to which the civic address relates;
a ground sign shall be mounted perpendicular to the private road or highway and clear of all obstructions so that it is visible when approaching from either direction;
if the support structure obstructs visibility of one side of the sign, the civic number shall be displayed on both sides of the sign;
the civic number displayed on a ground sign shall comply with the minimum character height in Table 1; and
the civic number shall be displayed at a minimum height above grade of 1.2 m.
Where, in the opinion of the Chief Building Official, the location of the building on a lot is such that the civic numbering display requirements outlined in this Schedule are inadequate with respect to the visibility of the civic number from the private road or highway, the Chief Building Official may impose additional requirements relating to the visibility of the civic number to ensure efficient wayfinding and public safety.
