Generally, a TIR is required for the proposed removal of municipal trees city-wide, or of distinctive trees on properties one hectare or less in size within the City‚Äôs urban area. A TIR is also required for all Committee of Adjustment applications and Building Permit applications for infill development[1] within the City‚Äôs urban area.<p>The type of application, or the tree removal reason for a given site dictates if a TIR or a TCR is required. Figure 1, on the last page, will help determine which type of report is required.<p>Table 1 outlines the information required to be included within Tree Information Reports. For all <em>Planning Act</em> applications<sup>2</sup>, a Tree Conservation Report is required. Please refer to the TCR Guidelines in Schedule E of the Tree Protection By-law.

Where the Tree Information Report submission is related to infill development or other construction projects requiring approvals, tree permits will be issued in conjunction with the development approval (eg. building permit, demolition permit, pool enclosure, etc.). However, these other approvals do not in themselves convey permission to remove trees.<p><strong>For Building Permits for infill development</strong>:<strong> </strong>Where there are no trees on the site or neighbouring properties which could be impacted by the proposed work, a statement on the grading plan or site plan that there are no trees on the site must be included.<p><strong>Exemptions</strong>: Where trees are an immediate threat to public health and safety or qualify for other exemptions listed in Part VI of the Tree Protection By-law, no report is required.<h3><strong>Required information:</strong></h3><p>For both the TIR-short and TIR-full, complete the Tree Information Report form with the following information:<p><strong>Contact Information for the Owner, Arborist, and Contractor</strong>:<p>Please provide name, address, telephone number and email address for the property owner, the arborist, and, if known at the time of application, the contractor.<p><strong>Tree Information</strong><strong>:</strong><p>Specific information about the tree(s) on site is required and shall be provided in a table format (see below).

For trees on a shared property line, list the address it is shared with.<h6><sup>5</sup> ‚Äú<strong>boundary tree</strong>‚Äù means a tree, of which any part of the trunk is growing across one or more property lines.<br><br><sup>6</sup> <strong>‚Äúadjacent tree‚Äù</strong> means a tree whose trunk is growing on a property sharing a boundary with the subject site.</h6><p><strong>Condition:<em> </em></strong>Provide detailed information about the condition of the tree(s). Applications for tree removal based on the condition must provide greater detail on the conditions noted and may require additional documentation such as tree risk assessments (from a reputable source) to support the arborist‚Äôs recommendation. The determination of the condition will be based on some of the following factors, and should also consider the level of risk associated with the condition and whether any mitigation options are available:<ul><li>Structural Integrity (Have there been recent limb failures? List evidence of structural weaknesses, noticeable stress cracks, frost cracks, weak unions, and included bark unions)<li>Deadwood (%)<li>Vigour (Is the tree healthy and in leaf, or in decline and struggling?)<li>Are there any insects infesting?

(list type and extent of decay)<li>Is decay evident at unions, base, or elsewhere? A bore test, ultrasound or resistograph may be required to determine extent of decay.<li>Is the tree causing damage to structures? List type and location of damage. May require additional reports and/or proof of remedial work completed. Requests to remove a City tree for this reason must follow the 4-phase assessment process for <a href=//ottawa.ca/en/living-ottawa/environment/trees-plants-and-forests#foundation-damage>trees and foundation damage</a>.<li>Does the tree have a significant lean? Are there signs of potential uprooting with a pull test?<li>Or other factors deemed acceptable by the General Manager</ul><p><strong><em>Client‚Äôs Reason for Removal: </em></strong>Provide client‚Äôs reason for requesting tree removal. Examples could include, but are not limited to:<ul><li>For construction purposes, eg., new house, addition, landscaping, etc.<li>Safety (Is the tree hazardous? If yes, identify the concern)<li>Damage to a structure or private property (an engineer‚Äôs report may be required).<li>The tree is in decline and is no longer viable to maintain.</ul><p><strong><em><em>Arborist‚Äôs Recommendation</em>: </em></strong>Provide arborist‚Äôs recommendation for the tree(s), as well as any protection and/or mitigation measures to be implemented for retained trees.<p><strong>TIR ‚Äì Short</strong> ‚Äì The arborist must provide recommendation for the course of action for the tree(s).<p><strong>TIR-Full </strong>‚Äì The arborist must identify and recommend which tree(s) will be removed and which will be retained/protected, based on their assessment of the work proposed on site and the distance between the tree(s) and excavation. Recommendations should also include changes to the proposed work that would allow for tree retention. For retained/protected trees, mitigation measures must be illustrated and noted on the grading plan and site plan, as appropriate.<p>For trees that are to be retained and protected, the tree protection measures outlined in Part VI of the Tree Protection By-law must be implemented. Please also refer to the City‚Äôs <a href=//documents.ottawa.ca/sites/documents/files/tree_protection_specification_en.pdf>Tree Protection Specification</a>. If the full CRZ cannot be protected, mitigation measures must be described in the report, shown on the plan and implemented accordingly.<p><strong>Photographs<em>:</em></strong> Provide photographs of each tree to be removed, showing the condition of the tree and reason for removal, as applicable.<p><strong>Plans:</strong><p><strong>TIR-Short</strong> ‚Äì A plan may be required depending on the level of complexity of the work to be performed.<p><strong>TIR-Full</strong> ‚Äì Tree removal and tree protection information must include:<ul><li>A plan showing the locations of all trees (including boundary and adjacent trees) and their critical root zones<sup>7</sup>.<li>The location of tree protection fencing.<li>All proposed excavation limits<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;(including for buildings, projections, services, retaining walls, driveways, etc.).<li>Measurements from the nearest edge of the trunk to adjacent excavation limits.<li>All trees protected under the City‚Äôs Tree Protection By-law must be shown on the map. The map must use symbols or colours to differentiate between private trees and municipal trees, and whether the trees are proposed for retention or removal. Retained trees require protection measures to be shown and details on required mitigation practices also.</ul><p>All this information must be overlaid on the grading plan and site plan, and the plan must be updated with any changes made through the associated review process. Full TIRs without plans will not be accepted.<h6><sup>7</sup>The critical root zone (CRZ) is established as being 10 centimetres from the trunk of a tree for every 10 centimetre of trunk DBH measured in a radius around the tree. The CRZ is calculated as DBH x 10 cm.<br><br><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;‚Äúexcavation limits‚Äù means the full extent of excavation for the proposed work, including any required sloping or shoring.</h6><p><strong>Tree Retention and Protection (TIR-Full):</strong><p>Where trees are to be retained and protected, tree protection measures must be provided in the report and illustrated on the plan (accounting for physical constraints), mitigation strategies to be implemented prior to construction and maintained for the full duration of construction. Please refer Part VI of the City of Ottawa‚Äôs Tree Protection By-law for the required tree protection measures.<p><strong>Boundary tree confirmation (TIR-Full):</strong><p>Where trees that are jointly owned are impacted, consent from the other property owner must be obtained. The signature of the other property owner must be included on the application form to confirm consent. Where an agreement cannot be reached, adjustments to the proposed plan may be required. A Tree Removal Permit will not be issued without each owner‚Äôs consent.<p><strong>Tree Replacement Information (TIR-Full):<em> </em></strong>Any replacement planting must take place after the completion of work to be done or following construction project completion. For each replacement tree, provide:<ul><li>tree size<li>species<li>quantity<li>location on property (shown on the site plan or on a landscape plan<sup>9</sup>)</ul><h6><sup>9</sup>Proposed planting locations may be shown on the site plan or separated into a Landscape Plan. Any separate Landscape Plan submitted must show any retained trees in addition to trees proposed to be planted.</h6><p>The planting of large shade trees using a variety of species is encouraged to fulfill the objective of a diverse, sustainable urban forest.<p>Please refer to Schedule B&nbsp;of the City‚Äôs Tree Protection By-law for tree compensation requirements.<p>When planted, the replacement tree must be a minimum of 50 mm measured no less than 15 cm above ground level for deciduous trees, and no less than 200 cm in height as measured from ground level to midway between the tip of the leader and the uppermost whorl, or as otherwise approved by the General Manager.<p><strong>Additional information:</strong><p>Depending on the complexity of the work to be performed, other reports may be required. For example, a Tree Risk Assessment from a viable source (ISA, Arboriculture Canada, etc.) could be necessary to justify a tree removal, a Landscape Plan should be included to show any replacement/new planting, and a Butternut Health Assessment could be required if Butternut trees are on site.<p><strong>Federal and Provincial Regulations:</strong><p>The arborist is responsible to abide by all Federal and Provincial Regulations such as the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, etc. when evaluating and recommending best course of action for any site. If any Federal and Provincial Regulations apply to the specific site application, related permits or mitigation needs must be noted.<p><strong>Self-Declaration Statement:</strong><p>For both TIR-short and TIR-full, the application form must be signed by the property owner, arborist and contractor (if known at time of application), which confirms that all parties agree with the information provided and will respect the proposed work and mitigation measures. By signing the application, you are also acknowledging and understanding that an inspector may enter the property at a reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out an inspection. You also acknowledge and understand that through failure to abide by the recommendations of the approved Tree Information Report, damaging or destructing trees identified for protection, you will be responsible to bear fully the cost of compensation, removal, and replacement.<p>It is the owner/applicant‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that all protection and mitigation measures described in the TIR are followed, and where necessary are done so under the supervision of an arborist.<p><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong><em> <a href=//documents.ottawa.ca/sites/documents/files/tree_flowchart_en.pdf>Flow chart to determine what kind of tree report is required for a permit to remove a tree</a></em></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=field__item><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--layout paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="layout layout--bootstrap-grid-row-1 row"><div class="col collapse-region"><h2 class=no-toc><button aria-expanded=false aria-controls=section-dca34412-b088-4964-b973-90595b7174b7 data-target=#section-dca34412-b088-4964-b973-90595b7174b7 data-toggle=collapse role=button class="border border-primary rounded collapse-section no-toc btn-link btn">Schedule D ‚Äì Application Fees</button></h2><div class="collapse collapse-wrapper border border-primary border-top-0 no-gutters p-4 w-100" id=section-dca34412-b088-4964-b973-90595b7174b7><div class="layout__region layout__region--main col-12"><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--by-law-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h3><strong>Municipal Trees</strong></h3><p>For municipally owned trees, City wide:<ul><li>Applications associated with <em>Planning Ac</em>t applications (Site Plan, Plan of Subdivision, Plan of Condominium) ‚Äì included in development application fees<li>Applications associated with infill development ‚Äì $1,055&nbsp;per tree, maximized at five trees or $5,275<li>Applications for removal not associated with a <em>Planning Act</em> application or infill development ‚Äì $186&nbsp;per tree maximized at five trees or $930</ul><h3><strong>Private Trees</strong></h3><p>For private property in the urban area, regardless of property size:<ul><li>Applications associated with <em>Planning Act</em> applications (Site Plan, Plan of Subdivision, Plan of Condominium) ‚Äì included in development application fees<li>Applications associated with infill development ‚Äì $1,055&nbsp;per tree, maximized at five trees or $5,275<li>Applications for removal not associated with a <em>Planning Act </em>application or infill development ‚Äì $186&nbsp;per tree maximized at five trees or $930<li>Removal of dead, hazardous or ash trees does not require a permit application, follow exemption process</ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=field__item><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--layout paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="layout layout--bootstrap-grid-row-1 row"><div class="col collapse-region"><h2 class=no-toc><button aria-expanded=false aria-controls=section-6b36ffbc-e9d2-4d08-b9bb-d68407d47af8 data-target=#section-6b36ffbc-e9d2-4d08-b9bb-d68407d47af8 data-toggle=collapse role=button class="border border-primary rounded collapse-section no-toc btn-link btn">Schedule E - Tree Conservation Report Guidelines</button></h2><div class="collapse collapse-wrapper border border-primary border-top-0 no-gutters p-4 w-100" id=section-6b36ffbc-e9d2-4d08-b9bb-d68407d47af8><div class="layout__region layout__region--main col-12"><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--by-law-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h3>Introduction</h3><p>The importance of protecting vegetation cover on sites subject to development is outlined in the Official Plan (Section 4.7.2). The Tree Conservation Report (TCR) provides essential information that must be integrated with all plans for a site, including the grading, servicing and landscape plans, to ensure that trees are retained in development scenarios, where feasible, and that new trees will be accommodated and planted to contribute to the City‚Äôs forest cover target and to address a site‚Äôs tree loss.<p>The purpose of the Tree Conservation Report is to demonstrate how tree cover will be retained on the site, including mature trees, stands of trees, and hedgerows, using a design with nature approach to planning and engineering. A design with nature approach incorporates the natural features of a site into the design and engineering of a proposed development. This includes, but is not limited to, measures such as retention of vegetation, consideration of wildlife habitats, and respect for natural drainage patterns.<p>The report will consider natural features not only on the study site, but on the surrounding landscape as well. This will provide context for the site and show natural area representation surrounding the given site.<p>The report will identify and describe the vegetative cover on the site prior to development. It will provide a professional opinion on the priority of treed areas to be conserved. It will show how the priority features have been incorporated into the proposed development and how they will be adequately protected for the long-term.<p>The Tree Conservation Report Guidelines are meant to be applied in coordination with other City of Ottawa guidelines including the ‚ÄòSignificant Woodlands Guidelines for Identification, Evaluation and Impact Assessment‚Äô and the ‚ÄòEnvironmental Impact Statement Guidelines‚Äô.<h3>Process</h3><ul><li>The Tree Conservation Report is required for all Plans of Subdivision, Site Plan Control Applications, Common Elements Condominium Applications, and Vacant Land Condominium Applications where there is a tree<sup>10</sup> of 10 centimetres in diameter or greater on the site and/or if there is a tree on an adjacent site that has a Critical Root Zone (CRZ)<sup>11</sup> extending onto the development site.<li>The report will be prepared by an individual with proven expertise and/or professional qualifications in forestry, ecology, biology, arboriculture, or landscape architecture in accordance with the definition of ‚Äúarborist‚Äù in Section 1 of the Tree Protection By-law.<li>The TCR must be submitted prior to any activities occurring on-site that might impact the trees. It may be submitted at the time of pre-consultation, prior to an application being made, or with the application. In some cases, a preliminary Tree Conservation Report may be required to support on-site investigations (e.g., boreholes).<li>Amendments to the TCR shall be submitted for approval if changes are required as a result of investigative site works, infrastructure and engineering approvals, or other plan changes. Tree removal, and any activities that could injure trees, must not occur until the amendment has been approved.<li>At the discretion of the General Manager, the TCR may be combined with the Landscape Plan or the Environmental Impact Statement.<li>The removal of trees on the site cannot occur until written approval of the Tree Conservation Report has been granted through a tree permit (as per the Tree Protection By-law). The approval of the TCR will come in the form of a letter (the tree permit) from the General Manager, or designate, with conditions specific to the site, tree retention and associated tree protection, and tree removal.<li>The approved TCR is a requirement for the approval of the development applications listed above.<li>A copy of the report must be available on-site during tree removal, grading, construction, or any other site alteration activities, and for the duration of construction on the site.<li>The grading, servicing, and landscape plans as well as all other approved plans will be consistent with and follow the recommendations made and approved in the Tree Conservation Report.<li>Elements outlined in the Tree Conservation Report will be incorporated into conditions of draft plan approval and shown on the other approved plans (i.e., Landscape Plan, Grading Plan and/or Site Plan) where relevant.<li>The General Manager reserves the right to refuse or reject a submission and to ask for additional information by other qualified persons.<li>The General Manager may require that the report be prepared and stamped by a Registered Professional Forester (RPF).</ul><h6><sup>10</sup>‚ÄúTree‚Äù is defined as any species of woody perennial plant, including its root system, which has reached or can reach a minimum height of at least 450 cm at physiological maturity.<br><br><sup>11</sup>The critical root zone (CRZ) is established as being 10 centimetres from the trunk of a tree for every centimetre of trunk DBH measured in a radius around the tree. The CRZ is calculated as DBH x 10 cm.</h6><h3>Elements</h3><p>The Tree Conservation Report will include the following elements:<ol><li>An inventory of the trees currently on site, including species composition (where applicable), diameter at breast height, age, and condition and health of the trees.<li>Where appropriate, groups of trees may be combined into stands for inventory purposes.
