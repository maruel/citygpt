Confidential information includes information in the possession of, or received in confidence by the local board, that the local board is either prohibited from disclosing, or is required to refuse to disclose under the <em>Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act </em>(‚ÄúMFIPPA‚Äù).<li>Members of local boards shall not use information that is obtained in their capacity as a member, and that is not available to the general public, to further or seek to further the member‚Äôs private interest or to further or seek to further another person‚Äôs private interest.</ol><h3>Section 6 - Conduct at Local Board Meetings</h3><p>Members of local boards shall conduct themselves with decorum at all local board meetings in accordance with the provisions of the local board‚Äôs procedure by-law (as required under Section 238 of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>).<h3>Section 7 - Discrimination and Harassment</h3><p>All members of local boards have a duty to treat members of the public, one another and staff of the local board with respect and without abuse, bullying or intimidation, and to ensure that their work environment is free from discrimination and harassment. The <em>Ontario Human Rights Code</em> applies as well as any other applicable board policy on the matter.<h3>Section 8 - Improper Use of Influence</h3><p>Members of local boards are expected to perform their duties of office with integrity, accountability and transparency. Members of local boards should not use the status of their position to influence the decision of another individual to the private advantage of oneself, or one‚Äôs parents, children or spouse, staff members, friends, or associates, business or otherwise.<h3>Section 9 - Use of Board Property and Resources</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>In order to fulfill their roles as appointed officials, members of local boards have access to board resources such as property, equipment, services, staff and supplies. No member of a local board shall use, or permit the use of such resources for activities other than purposes connected with the discharge of local board duties.<li>No member shall obtain financial gain from the use or sale of board-developed intellectual property, computer programs, technological innovations, or other patent, trademark, copyright held by the board.</ol><h3>Section 10 - Conduct Respecting Staff</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Members shall be respectful of the role of staff of the local board, or City staff where applicable, to provide advice based on political neutrality and objectivity and without undue influence from an individual member of the local board or group of members.<li>Members should not:<ol><li>Maliciously or falsely injure the professional or ethical reputation, or the prospects or practice of board staff;<li>Compel board staff to engage in partisan political activities or be subjected to threats or discrimination for refusing to engage in such activities; or<li>Use, or attempt to use, their authority or influence for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any board staff member with the intent of interfering in staff‚Äôs duties.</ol></ol><h3>Section 11 - Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Members of local boards shall not accept gifts that would, to a reasonable member of the public, appear to be in grati¬≠tude for influence, to induce influence, or otherwise to go beyond the necessary and appropriate public functions involved. For these purposes, a gift, benefit or hospitality provided with the member‚Äôs knowledge to a member‚Äôs spouse, child, or parent, that is connected directly or indirectly to the performance of the member‚Äôs duties is deemed to be a gift to that member.<li>To enhance transparency and accountability with respect to gifts, benefits, tickets to events and hospitality, members will file an annual disclosure statement that will be added to the public Gifts Registry. Members of local boards are required to disclose all gifts, benefits, hospitality, tickets to events and sponsored travel received which individually exceed $100 from one source in a calendar year.<li>The disclosure statement must indicate:<ol><li>The nature of the gift, benefit, tickets to events or hospitality;<li>Its source and date of receipt;<li>The circumstances under which it was given or received;<li>Its estimated value;<li>What the recipient did with the gift; and<li>Whether the gift will at any point will be left with the local board or the City.</ol><li>On receiving a disclosure statement, the Integrity Commissioner, shall examine it to ascertain whether the receipt of the gift, benefit, tickets to events or hospitality might, in his or her opinion, create a conflict between a private interest and the public duty of the member.<li>In the event that the Integrity Commissioner makes that preliminary determination, he or she shall call upon the Member to justify receipt of the gift or benefit.<li>Should the Integrity Commissioner determine that receipt was inappropriate, he or she may direct the Member to return the gift or remit the value of any gift or benefit already consumed to the City.<li>The following are recognized as exceptions and do not require registration:<ol><li>compensation authorized by law;<li>such gifts, benefits tickets to events or hospitality that normally accompany the responsibilities of office and are received as an incident of protocol or social obligation;<li>a political contribution otherwise reported by law, in the case of members running for office;<li>services provided without compensation by persons volunteering their time;<li>a suitable memento of a function honouring the member;<li>food, lodging, transportation and entertainment provided by provincial, regional and local governments or political subdivisions of them, by the federal government or by a foreign government within a foreign country, or by a conference, seminar or event organizer where the member is either speaking or attending in an official capacity;<li>food and beverages consumed at banquets, receptions or similar events, if:<ol><li>attendance serves a legitimate business purpose;<li>the person extending the invitation or a representative of the organization is in attendance; and<li>the value is reasonable and the invitations infrequent;</ol><li>communications connected with the role of a member, including subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals;<li>gifts of a nominal value (e.g. baseball cap, t-shirt, flash drive, book, etc.); and<li>any other gift or personal benefit, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion it is unlikely that receipt of the gift or benefit gives rise to a reasonable presumption that the gift or benefit was given in order to influence the Member in the performance of his or her duties.</ol><li>The Gifts Registry will be updated on an annual basis and posted on the City‚Äôs website for public viewing.</ol><h3>Section 12 - Election-Related Activity</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Members of local boards are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the <em>Municipal Elections Act, 1996</em> and the local board‚Äôs policy regarding use of board resources during the election campaign period (as required under Section 88.18 of the <em>Municipal Elections Act, 1996</em>).<li>The use of board resources, both actual property and staff time, for election-related activity is strictly prohibited. The prohibition applies to both the promotion and opposition to the candidacy of a person for elected office.
