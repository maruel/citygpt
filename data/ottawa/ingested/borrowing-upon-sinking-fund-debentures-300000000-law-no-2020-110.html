The Capital Work was authorized on the basis of debentures being issued therefor by By-law No. 2019-18 enumerated in Column 2 of Schedule ‚ÄúA‚Äù. The Council of the City of Ottawa has authorized debentures to be issued for the Capital Work in the respective amounts shown in Column 3 of Schedule ‚ÄúA‚Äù for three different components of the Capital Work described therein. Before authorizing the Capital Work the Council of the City of Ottawa had its Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer calculate an updated limit in respect of its most recent annual debt and financial obligation limit received from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in accordance with the applicable regulation. Prior to the Council of the City of Ottawa authorizing the Capital Work the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer determined that the estimated annual amount payable in respect of the Capital Work would not cause the City of Ottawa to exceed its updated limit and that the approval of the Capital Work by the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal pursuant to the applicable regulation was not required;<p>AND WHEREAS on April 11, 2007 the City of Ottawa adopted a Capital Financing and Debt Policy which was subsequently amended (the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) and which establishes the administrative framework and guidelines for issuing short and long-term debt;<p>And Whereas on September 11, 2019 by By-law No. 2019-280 the City of Ottawa authorized the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer and the City Manager jointly to place any debenture by-law required for debt issued during the term of council&nbsp;directly on the Agenda of the Finance and Economic Development Committee or Council.<p>And Whereas the Policy provides that if such delegated authority is exercised by the Finance and Economic Development Committee such debt issuance shall be reported to Council at the earliest opportunity after such debt issuance.<p>And Whereas on April 8, 2020 by By-law No. 2020-99 the City of Ottawa adopted and confirmed the report from the Deputy City Treasurer on the subject of <em>‚ÄúCity Debenture Issuance</em>‚Äù (the ‚ÄúReport), pursuant to which the City of Ottawa amongst other things, delegated the authority to the Mayor or his designate to execute and enact the necessary debenture by-laws associated with the Report to authorize the issuance of debentures where the project debt authority has been approved by Council over the 2020 time period with a provision that this delegated authority be reviewed at the first in-person Council meeting once the COVID-19 emergency has ended.<p>And Whereas the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer has, in accordance with Section 12 of Schedule ‚ÄúB‚Äù of By-law No. 2019-280, and pursuant to the Policy, authorized a debenture issue by entering into a letter agreement dated May 4, 2020 with the Principals described therein for the issue and sale of sinking fund debentures in the principal amount of $300,000,000.00, on the credit of the City of Ottawa (the ‚ÄúPurchase Letter‚Äù) for the Capital Work, payable at the time and bearing interest as hereinafter set forth;<p>Therefore&nbsp;the Mayor of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:<h3>Section 1</h3><p>For the Capital Work, the borrowing upon the credit of the City of Ottawa of the principal amount of $300,000,000.00 and the issue of sinking fund debentures therefor within the term of years set out in Column 6 of Schedule ‚ÄúA‚Äù, are hereby authorized.<h3>Section 2</h3><p>The Mayor and the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer are hereby authorized to cause any number of sinking fund debentures in the principal amount of&nbsp;$300,000,000.00, as described in section 1 above, (the ‚ÄúDebentures‚Äù) payable as to principal on May 11, 2051 with semi-annual instalments of interest thereon on each of May 11 and November 11 (commencing on November 11, 2020) to be issued for such amounts of money as may be required for the Capital Work in global and definitive forms, not exceeding in total the said principal amount of $300,000,000.00. The Debentures shall bear the City of Ottawa‚Äôs municipal seal and the signatures of the Mayor and of the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer, all in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The municipal seal of the City of Ottawa and the signatures referred to in this section may be printed, lithographed, engraved or otherwise mechanically reproduced. The Debentures are sufficiently signed if they bear the required signatures and each person signing has the authority to do so on the date he or she signs. The Debentures shall initially be issued in global fully registered form as six certificates, each in the principal amount of $50,000,000.00 (in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000.00), each substantially in the form attached as&nbsp;Schedule ‚ÄúB‚Äù hereto and forming part of this By-law (the ‚ÄúGlobal Debentures‚Äù). The Global Debentures shall initially be issued in the name of CDS & CO. as nominee of CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (‚ÄúCDS‚Äù), and each Global Debenture shall provide for payment of principal and interest electronically in final and irrevocable same- day funds in accordance with the applicable requirements of CDS, so long as the Global Debentures are held by CDS.<h3>Section 3</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>&nbsp;The Debentures shall all be dated the 11th day of May, 2020, and as to both principal and interest shall be expressed and be payable in lawful money of Canada. The Debentures shall be issued for a term of approximately 31 years bearing interest at the rate of 2.50% per annum and shall be payable on the 11th day of May, 2051. In each year during such period, the amount of $7,500,000.00 shall be payable for interest on the Debentures in semi-annual instalments of $3,750,000.00 on each of May 11 and November 11 (commencing on November 11, 2020). The amount of $7,078,904.17 shall be deposited on or before May 11 (commencing on May 11, 2021) by the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer, or an authorized official of the City of Ottawa, into a sinking fund (the ‚ÄúSinking Fund‚Äù), which amount, with interest compounded annually, will be sufficient to pay at maturity (May 11, 2051) the principal of the Debentures, as required by the provisions of this By-law, the Act and the Policy.<li>Payments in respect of contributions to the Sinking Fund as well as principal of and interest on the Debentures shall be made only on a day on which banking institutions in Toronto, Ontario and Ottawa, Ontario, are not authorized or obligated by law or executive order to be closed (a ‚ÄúBusiness Day‚Äù) and if any date for payment is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day and no further interest shall be paid in respect of the delay in such payment.</ol><h3>Section 4</h3><p>Interest shall be payable to the date of maturity of the Debentures and on default shall be payable both before and after default and judgment. Any amounts payable by the City of Ottawa as interest on overdue principal or interest in respect of the Debentures shall be paid out of current revenue. Whenever it is necessary to compute any amount of interest in respect of the Debentures for a period of less than one full year, other than with respect to regular interest payments, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the period and a year of 365 days or 366 days, if applicable.<h3>Section 5</h3><p>In limited circumstances (as agreed to by both the City of Ottawa and CDS) the Global Debentures shall be exchangeable for certificated Debentures in definitive fully registered form in authorized denominations upon surrender of the Global Debentures to the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer. Any of the Debentures issued as definitive Debentures may, with the approval of the Mayor be countersigned in writing by officials so designated by the Mayor. The definitive Debentures shall aggregate the&nbsp;same principal amount as the principal outstanding balance of the Global Debentures as of the record date for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of the Global Debentures, shall bear the same interest rate and maturity date, shall bear all unmatured interest obligations and shall have the same benefits and be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Global Debentures (except insofar as they specifically relate to the Global Debentures). In issuing definitive Debentures no change shall be made in the amount which would otherwise be payable in each year under the Global Debentures. The definitive Debentures shall be in fully registered form, payable as to principal and outstanding interest in lawful money of Canada at maturity upon presentation and surrender thereof at any specified branch in Canada of the City of Ottawa‚Äôs bank designated in the definitive Debentures. Prior to maturity the definitive Debentures shall be payable as to interest by cheque sent by mail to the registered addresses of the registered holders or, if authorized in writing, by electronic transfer.<h3>Section 6</h3><p>In respect of the Debentures there shall be raised, as part of the general municipal levy the amount of $7,500,000.00 for interest on the Debentures in semi- annual instalments of $3,750,000.00 on each of May 11 and November 11 (commencing on November 11, 2020). There shall also be raised in each year during the said period, as part of the general municipal levy, the amount of $7,078,904.17 for deposit into the Sinking Fund on or before May 11 (commencing on May 11, 2021) for the payment at maturity (May 11, 2051) of the principal of the Debentures. In each such year, for the Capital Work, the said two amounts (the amount for interest and the amount for the contribution to the Sinking Fund) shall be raised as part of the general municipal levy, to the extent that such amounts have not been provided for by any other available source including, without limitation, federal and provincial gas taxes and development charges in addition to other taxes or fees or charges imposed on persons or property by a by-law of any municipality.<h3>Section 7</h3><p>The Debentures may contain any provision for their registration thereof authorized by any statute relating to municipal debentures in force at the time of the issue thereof.<h3>Section 8</h3><p>The City of Ottawa shall maintain a registry in respect of the Debentures in which shall be recorded the names and the addresses of the registered holders and particulars of the Debentures held by them respectively and in which particulars of the cancellations, exchanges, substitutions and transfers of Debentures may be recorded and the City of Ottawa is authorized to use electronic, magnetic or other media for records of or related to the Debentures or for copies of them.<h3>Section 9</h3><p>The City of Ottawa shall not be bound to see to the execution of any trust affecting the ownership of any Debenture or be affected by notice of any equity that may be subsisting in respect thereof.
