(2014-443)<li>Unless it will undermine the City‚Äôs best interests, final approval and the awarding of the contract shall be postponed pending the outcome of the complaint process. This suspension may be set aside, and final approval for the awarding of a contract may be given, at any time in the complaints process if it is in the City‚Äôs best interests to do so.<li>If the Chief Procurement Officer concludes that the complaint does not disclose credible information to indicate that a breach of the terms of the procurement process or City policies has occurred, no further review of the complaint will take place and the contract shall be awarded in accordance with this By-law.<li>If the complaint is found to disclose a reasonable indication that the procurement was not carried out in accordance with the City‚Äôs policies or the terms of the procurement process, the Chief Procurement Officer will take such necessary action to bring the solicitation back into compliance, which may include the cancellation of the solicitation, or the suspension or cancellation of the bid award. If the issue cannot be resolved appropriately, the Chief Procurement Officer will then refer the matter to a Review Panel, as provided in clause (c), ‚ÄúPhase Three‚Äù. (2014-443).</ol><li>Phase Three: Formal Review:<ol><li>Where the Chief Procurement Officer has received a complaint that discloses a reasonable indication that the procurement at issue was not carried out in accordance with the City‚Äôs procurement policies and/or the terms of the procurement process, it is to be considered by a Review Panel comprised of the Chief Procurement Officer, the City Solicitor (or a designated lawyer from the Legal Services), a representative from the Auditor General‚Äôs office and the Fairness Commissioner if applicable. (2021-26)<li><span lang=EN-CA dir=ltr>The Review Panel after considering the complaint will provide a report to the Finance and Corporate Services Committee setting out its recommendation for how the complaint should be dealt with. (2014-443, 2025-33)</span><li>The Review Panel report to the Committee will include a description of the procurement process at issue and an overview of the complaint received from the unsuccessful bidder. The panel report will recommend a specific course of action including, where appropriate, an explanation for why that course of action is recommended in response to the complaint.<li>The report is to be submitted to the Committee within twenty business days from the date upon which the Chief Procurement Officer referred the complaint to the Review Panel.</ol><li><span lang=EN-CA dir=ltr>Phase Four: Role of Finance and Corporate Services Committee (2025-33):</span><ol><li><span lang=EN-CA dir=ltr>The Finance and Corporate Services Committee is to consider the report at the next regularly scheduled meeting. (2014-443, 2025-33)</span><li>The Committee will hear any delegations at the meeting in the standard manner, including the unsuccessful bidder who filed the formal complaint.<li>The Committee will either endorse the course of action recommended by the Review Panel or adopt an alternative course of action that it considers &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate under the circumstances and is consistent with the terms of the solicitation and/or the City‚Äôs procurement policies. &nbsp;The Committee‚Äôs decision is final and it will not conduct a second separate review of the complaint. &nbsp;(2010-291)</ol></ol></ol><h3>Section 47 -&nbsp;Litigation exclusion provision</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>The City, acting through the Chief Procurement Officer in consultation with the City Solicitor, may in its absolute discretion after considering the criteria outlined in subsection (2), reject a quotation, tender, or proposal submitted by a bidder if the City is engaged in legal action against the bidder, or, if the bidder or any officer or director of the bidder is engaged, either directly or indirectly through a corporation or personally, in a legal action against the City, its elected representatives, appointed officers, or employees, &nbsp;in relation to:<ol><li>any other related contract or services; or<li>any matter arising from the City‚Äôs exercise of its powers, duties, or functions. (2014-443, 2017-362, 2021-26)</ol><li>In determining whether or not to reject a quotation, tender or proposal under this clause, the Chief Procurement Officer and the City Solicitor will consider; (2017-362, 2021-26)<ol><li>whether the litigation is likely to adversely affect the bidder‚Äôs ability to work with the City, its consultants and representatives; or,<li>whether the City‚Äôs experience with the bidder indicates that the City is likely to incur increased staff and legal costs in the administration of the contract if it is awarded to the bidder; or,<li>whether the bidder has been convicted of a criminal act against the City or one of its local boards or corporations; or,<li>whether the bidder has failed to satisfy an outstanding debt to the City or one of its local boards or corporations; or,<li>there are reasonable grounds to believe it would not be in the best interests of the City to enter into a contract with the bidder. &nbsp;</ol><li>(3) Supply Services is to advise Council by way of a memorandum when the Chief Procurement Officer, in consultation with the City Solicitor, intends to exercise his or her discretion to reject a quotation, tender, or proposal in accordance with subsection (1).
