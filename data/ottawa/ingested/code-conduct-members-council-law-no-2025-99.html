Members of Council should not knowingly communicate with a lobbyist who is acting in violation of the requirements of the Registry. If a Member of Council is or at any time becomes aware that a person is in violation of the rules related to lobbying, the Member should either refuse to deal with the lobbyist or, where appropriate, either terminate the communication with the lobbyist at once or, if in the Member‚Äôs judgment it is appropriate to continue the communication, at the end of the communication, draw that person‚Äôs attention to the obligations imposed by the Registry and report the communication to the City Clerk and to the Integrity Commissioner.<li>Unless pre-approved by the Integrity Commissioner, the acceptance of any gift, benefit, or hospitality from lobbyists with active lobbying registrations or from their registered clients or their employees by Members of Council or their staff is prohibited.<li>The principle here is to ensure that companies and individuals who may be seeking to do business with the City do not do so by giving gifts or favours to people in a position to influence vendor approval or decision-making.<li>The acceptance of sponsorships for events supported or organized by Members of Council is governed by the <em>Community, Fundraising and Special Events Policy</em>.</ol><h3>Section 13 - Gifts, Benefits and Hospitality</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Members of Council are expected to represent the public and the interests of the municipality and to do so with both impartiality and objectivity. The acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality can imply favouritism, bias or influence on the part of the Member. At times, the acceptance of a gift, benefit or hospitality occurs as part of the social protocol or community events linked to the duties of an elected official and their role in representing the municipality.<li>Members of Council shall not accept gifts that would, to a reasonable member of the public, appear to be in grati¬≠tude for influence, to induce influence, or otherwise to go beyond the necessary and appropriate public functions involved. For these purposes, a gift, benefit or hospitality provided with the Member‚Äôs knowledge to a Member‚Äôs spouse, child, or parent, or to a Member‚Äôs staff that is connected directly or indirectly to the performance of the Member‚Äôs duties is deemed to be a gift to that Member.<li>To enhance transparency and accountability with respect to gifts, benefits and hospitality, Members of Council will file a quarterly disclosure statement that will be added to a public Gifts Registry. Members of Council are required to disclose all gifts, benefits, hospitality and sponsored travel received which individually exceed $100 from one source in a calendar year.<li>The disclosure statement must indicate:<ol><li>The nature of the gift, benefit or hospitality;<li>Its source and date of receipt;<li>The circumstances under which it was given or received;<li>Its estimated value;<li>What the recipient intends to do with the gift; and<li>Whether the gift will at any point will be left with the City.</ol><li>In the case of requirement (f) of the disclosure statement, those gifts received by Members of Council which have significance or historical value for the City of Ottawa shall be left with City Archives when the Member ceases to hold office.</ol><p><strong>&nbsp;Acceptance of Event Tickets&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ol class=bylawlist start=6><li>The City of Ottawa is home to many types of festivals, community, cultural and sports events. The City is also the host site for many federal, provincial, National Capital Commission events. Consequently, Members of Council are often expected to attend or are frequently encouraged to attend by being provided with tickets or invitations.<li>As with gifts, the acceptance of this kind of benefit can appear to be a means of undue influence. While the choice of venues and events they attend is entirely at the discretion of Members of Council, when accepting tickets as a gift or benefit, Members of Council shall observe the following limits:<ol><li>To further enhance transparency all tickets of a value exceeding $30 shall be disclosed quarterly in the Gifts Registry, along with the disposition thereof (e.g. who attended with the Member, or if donated, to whom or what organization).<li>A limit of two tickets for up to two events from one source in a calendar year is permitted and requires disclosure;<li>Accepting any tickets for subsequent events from the same source is prohibited.</ol><li>On receiving a disclosure statement, the Integrity Commissioner, shall examine it to ascertain whether the receipt of the gift or benefit might, in their opinion, create a conflict between a private interest and the public duty of the Member or in consultation with the City Archivist whether the gift has significance or historical value for the City.<li>In the event that the Integrity Commissioner makes that preliminary determination, they shall call upon the Member to justify receipt of the gift or benefit.<li>Should the Integrity Commissioner determine that receipt was inappropriate, they may direct the Member to return the gift or remit the value of any gift or benefit already consumed to the City.<li>The following are recognized as exceptions and do not require registration:<ol><li>compensation authorized by law;<li>such gifts or benefits that normally accompany the responsibilities of office and are received as an incident of protocol or social obligation;<li>a political contribution otherwise reported by law, in the case of members running for office;<li>services provided without compensation by persons volunteering their time;<li>a suitable memento of a function honouring the member;<li>food, lodging, transportation and entertainment provided by provincial, regional and local governments or political subdivisions of them, by the federal government or by a foreign government within a foreign country, or by a conference, seminar or event organizer where the member is either speaking or attending in an official capacity;<li>food and beverages consumed at banquets, receptions or similar events, if:<ol><li>attendance serves a legitimate business purpose;<li>the person extending the invitation or a representative of the organization is in attendance; and<li>the value is reasonable and the invitations infrequent;</ol><li>communication to the offices of a member, including subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals;<li>sponsorships and donations for community events organized or run by a Member or a third party on behalf of a member, subject to the limitations set in the Council Expense Policy;<li>gifts of a nominal value (e.g. baseball cap, t-shirt, flash drive, book, etc.); and<li>any other gift or personal benefit, if the Integrity Commissioner is of the opinion it is unlikely that receipt of the gift or benefit gives rise to a reasonable presumption that the gift or benefit was given in order to influence the Member in the performance of their duties.</ol><li>The Gifts Registry will be updated on a quarterly basis and posted on the City‚Äôs website for public viewing.</ol><h3>Section 14 - Election-Related Activity</h3><p>Members of Council are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the Municipal Elections Act, 1996 and the City‚Äôs Election-Related Resources Policy. The use of municipal resources, both actual municipal property and staff time, for election-related activity is strictly prohibited. The prohibition applies to both the promotion and opposition to the candidacy of a person for elected office. Election-related activity applies not only to a Member‚Äôs personal campaign for office, but also other campaigns for municipal, provincial and federal office.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=field__item><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--layout paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="layout layout--bootstrap-grid-row-1 row"><div class="col collapse-region"><h2 class=no-toc><button aria-expanded=false aria-controls=section-177d24a8-6989-4d21-a302-3bdf5ef7409c data-target=#section-177d24a8-6989-4d21-a302-3bdf5ef7409c data-toggle=collapse role=button class="border border-primary rounded collapse-section no-toc btn-link btn">Part III</button></h2><div class="collapse collapse-wrapper border border-primary border-top-0 no-gutters p-4 w-100" id=section-177d24a8-6989-4d21-a302-3bdf5ef7409c><div class="layout__region layout__region--main col-12"><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--by-law-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h3>Section 15 - Compliance with the Code of Conduct</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Members of Council are expected to adhere to the provisions of the Code of Conduct.
