Protection of the public by fencing</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>Every fence required under Section 40(1) shall be erected in accordance with the following:<ol><li>be located between the site and the public way or the open sides of a construction site to fully enclose the activity,<li>have an unobstructed fence height above grade when measured from outside the enclosure of at least:<ol><li>1.8 m high for the construction, alteration or demolition activity of any type of building, that is located 3.0 m or less from a public way, or is adjacent to an area of extra hazard, or<li>1.2 m high for the construction, alteration or demolition activity of a residential building of no more than 3 storeys that is located more than 3.0 m from an adjacent public way, and</ol><li>where the building or structure is located adjacent to a ‚Äúpublic way‚Äù as defined by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chap.

so as to prevent the passage of a spherical object having a diameter of 100mm, and<li>the fence shall be erected with adequate supports and maintained in a sturdy, upright condition such that the effective height of the protection is not reduced.</ol><li>Every access opening in a fence shall be equipped with a gate that shall be:<ol><li>constructed of materials equivalent to the performance of the fence,<li>identified clearly as the point of access into or exit from the site, and<li>securely closed and locked when the construction or demolition site is unattended.</ol><li>Where any special

time, day or night.</ol><h3>Section 42 - Removal of fencing</h3><ol class=bylawlist><li>The fence installed to enclose the site shall be removed no more than thirty (30) days after the completion of the construction or demolition work.<li>Where the construction or demolition is substantially suspended or abandoned and the site no longer deemed unsafe by the Chief Building Official, the fence installed to enclose the site may be required to be removed by the Inspector.<li>Failure to remove the fence within ten (10) business days of receipt of a notice from the Inspector may result in the Chief Building Official arranging to remove the fence and all associated costs shall be invoiced to the owner and costs not recovered within 30 days of invoicing shall be tax rolled.<li>Subsections
