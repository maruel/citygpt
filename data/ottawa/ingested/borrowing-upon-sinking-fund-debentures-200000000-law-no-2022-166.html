The Capital Work, including the two different components of the Capital Work described in Column 1 of Schedule "A", each of which constitutes a capital work, were authorized on the basis of debentures being issued therefor by authorizing By-law No. 2019-58 (enumerated in Column 2 of Schedule "A"). The Council of the City of Ottawa has authorized debentures to be issued for each of the two different components of the Capital Work in the respective amounts shown in Column 3 of Schedule "A". Before authorizing the Capital Work and such two different components of the Capital Work, the Council of the City of Ottawa had its Chief Financial Officer <em>I </em>Treasurer calculate an updated limit in respect of its most recent annual debt and financial obligation limit received from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in accordance with the applicable regulation. Prior to the Council of the City of Ottawa authorizing the Capital Work, including each such component of the Capital Work, the Chief Financial Officer <em>I </em>Treasurer determined that the estimated annual amount payable in respect of the Capital Work, including each such component of the Capital Work, would not cause the City of Ottawa to exceed its updated limit and that the approval of the Capital Work, including each such component of the Capital Work, by the Ontario Land Tribunal's predecessor pursuant to the applicable regulation was not required;<p class=MsoBodyText>AND WHEREAS on April 11, 2007 the City of Ottawa adopted a Capital Financing and Debt Policy which was subsequently amended (the "Policy") and which establishes the administrative framework and guidelines for issuing short and long-term debt;<p class=MsoBodyText>AND WHEREAS on February 9, 2022 by By-law No. 2022-29, as subsequently amended (the "Delegation of Authority By-law") the City of Ottawa authorized the Chief Financial Officer/ Treasurer and the City Manager jointly to place any debenture by-law required for debt issued during the term of Council directly on the Agenda of the Debenture Committee;<p class=MsoBodyText>AND WHEREAS the Delegation of Authority By-law provides that the exercise of such delegated authority shall be reported to Council at the earliest opportunity after such debt issuance;<p class=MsoBodyText>AND WHEREAS the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer has, in accordance with Section 12 of Schedule "B" of the Delegation of Authority By-law, and pursuant to the Policy, authorized a debenture issue by entering into a letter agreement dated May 26, 2022 with the Principals described therein for the issue and sale of sinking fund debentures in the principal amount of $200,000,000.00 pursuant to the Green Debenture Framework, on the credit of the City of Ottawa (the "Purchase Letter") for the financing of the two different components of the Capital Work, payable at the time and bearing interest as hereinafter set forth.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=field__item><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--layout paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="layout layout--bootstrap-grid-row-1 row"><div class="col collapse-region"><h2 class=no-toc><button aria-expanded=false aria-controls=section-1f1f77f4-cd31-42ae-8a40-f792559b158a data-target=#section-1f1f77f4-cd31-42ae-8a40-f792559b158a data-toggle=collapse role=button class="border border-primary rounded collapse-section no-toc btn-link btn">By-law</button></h2><div class="collapse collapse-wrapper border border-primary border-top-0 no-gutters p-4 w-100" id=section-1f1f77f4-cd31-42ae-8a40-f792559b158a><div class="layout__region layout__region--main col-12"><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--by-law-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p><span>THEREFORE the Debenture Committee of the City of Ottawa enacts as&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-US dir=ltr>follows:</span><h3><span>Section 1</span></h3><p><span>For the Capital Work and specifically for the two different components of the Capital Work described in Column 1 of Schedule "A", the borrowing upon the credit of the City of Ottawa of the principal amount of $200,000,000.00 and the issue of sinking fund debentures therefor within the term of years set out in Column 6 of Schedule "A", in minimum denominations of $1,000.00, as hereinafter set forth, are hereby authorized in accordance with the Green Debenture Framework.</span><h3><span>Section 2</span></h3><p><span>The Mayor or a designate and the Chief Financial Officer/ Treasurer or a designate are hereby authorized to cause any number of sinking fund debentures in the principal amount of $200,000,000.00, as described in section 1 above, (the "Debentures") to be issued for such amounts of money as may be required for the aforesaid two different components of the Capital Work in global and definitive forms, not exceeding in total the said principal amount of $200,000,000.00. The Debentures will be payable as to principal on December 6, 2052 with semi-annual instalments of interest thereon on each of June 6 and December 6 (commencing on December 6, 2022). The Debentures shall bear the City of Ottawa's municipal seal and the signatures of the Mayor or of a designate and of the Chief Financial Officer/ Treasurer or of a designate, all in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Debentures are sufficiently signed if they bear the required signatures and each person signing has the authority to do so on the date he or she signs. The Debentures shall initially be issued in global fully registered form as four certificates, each in the principal amount of</span>&nbsp;<span>$50,000,000.00 (in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000.00), each substantially in the form attached as Schedule "B" hereto and forming part of this By-law (the "Global Debentures"). The Global Debentures shall initially be issued in the name of CDS & CO. as nominee of CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. ("CDS"), and</span>&nbsp;<span>each Global Debenture shall provide for payment of principal and interest electronically in final and irrevocable same-day funds in accordance with the applicable requirements of CDS, so long as the Global Debentures are held by CDS.</span><h3><span>Section 3</span></h3><p><span>(1)&nbsp; The Debentures shall all be dated the 6th day of June, 2022, and as to both principal and interest shall be expressed and be payable in lawful money of Canada. The Debentures shall be issued for a term of 30 years bearing interest at the rate of 4.10% per annum and shall be payable on the 6th day of December, 2052. In each year during such period, the amount of $8,200,000.00 shall be payable for interest on the Debentures in semi-annual instalments of $4,100,000.00 on each of June 6 and December 6 (commencing on December 6, 2022).&nbsp; The amount of</span>&nbsp;<span>$4,126,778.28 shall be deposited on or before June 6 (commencing on June 6, 2023) by the Chief Financial Officer/ Treasurer or a designate, or an authorized official of the City of Ottawa, into a sinking fund (the "Sinking Fund"), which amount, with interest compounded annually, will be sufficient to pay at maturity (December 6, 2052) the principal amount of the Debentures, as required by the provisions of this By-law, the Act and the Policy.</span><p>(2)&nbsp;<span>Payments in respect of contributions to the Sinking Fund as well as principal of and interest on the Debentures shall be made only on a day on which banking institutions in Toronto, Ontario and Ottawa, Ontario, are not authorized or obligated by law or executive order to be closed (a "Business Day") and if any date for payment is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day and no further interest shall be paid in respect of the delay in such payment.</span><h3><span>Section 4</span></h3><p><span>Interest shall be payable to the date of maturity of the Debentures and on default shall be payable both before and after default and judgment. Any amounts payable by the City of Ottawa as interest on overdue principal or interest in respect of the Debentures shall be paid out of current revenue. Whenever it is necessary to compute any amount of interest in respect of the Debentures for a period of less than one full year, other than with respect to regular interest payments, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the period and a year of 365 days or 366 days, if applicable.</span><h3><span>Section 5</span></h3><p><span>In limited circumstances (as agreed to by both the City of Ottawa and CDS) the Global Debentures shall be exchangeable for certificated Debentures in definitive fully registered form in authorized denominations upon surrender of the Global Debentures to the Chief Financial Officer / Treasurer or a designate. Any of the Debentures issued as definitive Debentures may, with the approval of the Mayor or of a designate be countersigned in writing by officials so designated by the Mayor. The definitive Debentures shall aggregate the same principal amount as the principal outstanding balance of the Global Debentures as of the record date for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of the Global Debentures, shall bear the same interest rate and maturity date, shall bear all unmatured interest obligations and shall have the&nbsp;same benefits and be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Global Debentures (except insofar as they specifically relate to the Global Debentures). In issuing definitive Debentures no change shall be made in the amount which would otherwise be payable in each year under the Global Debentures. The definitive Debentures shall be in fully registered form, payable as to principal and outstanding interest in lawful money of Canada at maturity upon presentation and surrender thereof at any specified branch in Canada of the City of Ottawa's bank designated in the definitive Debentures. Prior to maturity the definitive Debentures shall be payable as to interest by cheque sent by mail to the registered addresses of the registered holders or, if authorized in writing, by electronic transfer.</span><h3><span>Section 6</span></h3><p><span>In respect of the Debentures there shall be raised, as part of the general municipal levy the amount of $8,200,000.00 for interest on the Debentures in semi¬≠ annual instalments of $4,100,000.00 on each of June 6 and December 6 (commencing on December 6, 2022). There shall also be raised in each year during the said period, as part of the general municipal levy, the amount of $4,126,778.28 for deposit into the Sinking Fund on or before June 6 (commencing on June 6, 2023) for the payment at maturity (December 6, 2052) of the principal of the Debentures. In each such year, for the two different components of the Capital Work, the said two amounts (the amount for interest and the amount for the contribution to the Sinking Fund) shall be raised as part of the general municipal levy, to the extent that such amounts have not been provided for by any other available source including, without limitation, federal and provincial gas taxes and development charges in addition to other taxes or fees or charges imposed on persons or property by a by-law of any municipality.</span><h3>Section 7</h3><p><span>The Debentures may contain any provision for their registration thereof authorized by any statute relating to municipal debentures in force at the time of the issue thereof.</span><h3>Section 8</h3><p><span>The City of Ottawa shall maintain a registry in respect of the Debentures in which shall be recorded the names and the addresses of the registered holders and particulars of the Debentures held by them respectively and in which particulars of the cancellations, exchanges, substitutions and transfers of Debentures may be recorded and the City of Ottawa is authorized to use electronic, magnetic or other media for records of or related to the Debentures or for copies of them.</span><h3>Section 9</h3><p><span>The City of Ottawa shall not be bound to see to the execution of any trust affecting the ownership of any Debenture or be affected by notice of any equity that may be subsisting in respect thereof.
